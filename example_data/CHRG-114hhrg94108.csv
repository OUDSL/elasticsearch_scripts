CHRG-114hhrg94108,"----------                                                       Wednesday, February 25, 2015               U.S. House of Representatives,                     Committee on Homeland Security,                                                     Washington, DC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The committee met, pursuant to call, at 12:04 p.m., in Room  311, Cannon House Office Building, Hon."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Michael T. McCaul  [Chairman of the committee] presiding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Present: Representatives McCaul, Rogers, Barletta, Clawson,  Katko, Hurd, Carter, Walker, Loudermilk, McSally, Ratcliffe,  Thompson, Jackson Lee, Langevin, Richmond, Payne, Vela, Watson  Coleman, and Torres."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The Committee on Homeland Security will  come to order.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"First of all, my apologies to the Members and the  witnesses."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I had a conflict with the--on the Foreign Affairs  Committee with the Secretary of State on the authorized use of  military force against ISIS, which I think is a very relevant  issue to this committee, as well, in terms of dealing with the  threat where it exists before it can come into the United  States."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Anyway, I just want to thank everybody for your  patience."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I will give this opening statement.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Been involved in this  issue for quite some time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To Suzanne and Phyllis Schneck,  thank you for being here, Dr. Fischer."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"At the dawn of the digital age, our Nation saw endless  opportunities to generate prosperity by expanding our networks  and connecting to the world."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But today, American prosperity  depends as much on defending those networks as it does on  expanding them."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Every day, our country faces digital intrusions  from criminals, activists, terrorists, and nation-states like  Russia, China, and Iran."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The impact of those intrusions are  felt everywhere; from our National security secrets to the  personal information of Americans.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We cannot tolerate acts of cyber vandalism, theft, or cyber  warfare, especially when they put our Nation's critical  infrastructure at risk and when they steal American  intellectual property and innovations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Accordingly, our  Government must play a leading role in combating threats in the  digital domain."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is clear that safeguarding American cyber space is one  of the great National security challenges of our time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We are  confronted almost daily with frightening new precedents, such  as North Korea's act on Sony Pictures; a cowardly act meant to  intimidate Americans and stifle freedom of expression."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This  attack came from a nation-state using a digital bomb to target  and destroy computer systems here in the United States.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Iranian-backed hackers also demonstrated this capability  when they attacked Saudi Arabia's national oil company, Aramco,  and destroyed 30,000 computers."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Iran also targeted and  continues to target major U.S. banks to shut down websites and  restrict Americans' ability to access their bank accounts.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Imagine this type of attack on our gas pipelines or power  grids in the northeast.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Such assaults on our critical  infrastructure could cripple our economy and weaken our ability  to defend the United States.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,These scenarios sometimes sound  alarmist.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But we must take them seriously, as they grow more  realistic every day."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Our adversaries are hard at work  developing and refining cyber attack capabilities, and they are  using them to intimidate our Government and threaten our people  in both times of peace and times of conflict."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But the threat extends beyond the industrial engines that  drive our economies, to the homes of Americans themselves."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Criminals and countries alike can use cyber attacks to raid  Americans' saving accounts or steal their personal health  records.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The recent breach of health insurer Anthem illustrates  the intrusiveness of these attacks.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That assault alone exposed  the personal information of up to 80 million people, including  the names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers of tens of  millions of children."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But this is just the latest in a long string of cyber  breaches targeting private citizens, a list that includes  breaches at Target, Neiman Marcus, Home Depot, and J.P. Morgan."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Our adversaries are also seeking to steal secrets from our  Government and our most innovative companies.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We know that  Chinese hackers, for instance, continue to breach Federal  networks for the purpose of espionage and attack major U.S.  businesses to give themselves a competitive edge in the global  economy."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Make no mistake, these attacks are costing Americans their  time, their money, and their jobs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,General Keith Alexander  described cyber espionage and the loss of American intellectual  property as the greatest transfer of wealth in human history.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Sadly, our laws are not keeping up with the threat."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For  instance, fearing legal liability, many private companies  choose not to disclose the threats they see on their own  networks, leaving others vulnerable to the same intrusions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We  cannot leave the American people and our businesses to fend for  themselves.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Now more than ever, Congress must take aggressive  action."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This year I will lead a renewed effort to push  cybersecurity legislation through Congress.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Last year, the  Ranking Member and I in this committee passed five  cybersecurity bills."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,These new statutes lay out the rules of  the road on how cyber information will be shared between  Government and the private sector so that the two can work  together to combat this persistent threat.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The laws also provide important protections to ensure  Americans' information and civil liabilities are not  compromised.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But now we must build on that success.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We can  start by creating a safe harbor, where legal barriers to share  cyber threat information are removed and the private sector is  encouraged to collaborate."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This will allow us to respond to  cyber incidents more quickly and effectively and will give  Government and private entities the ability to see the threat  landscape in real time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I am pleased the President has come forward with a proposal  on this important issue.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Our solutions must transcend partisan  boundaries if we are going to tackle this challenge, and the  American people are counting on us."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Again, I want to thank the witnesses."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I want to thank the  Members for their patience here today.

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I now recognize the Ranking Member.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Thompson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Let me  also welcome our witnesses and thank them for their patience on  getting started.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Earlier, some of us were briefed on some on-going efforts  by the Department, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I might add, it was very  informative."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you all very much for doing it.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Our hearing today is examining the President's  cybersecurity information-sharing proposal.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Mr. Chairman, at  its core cybersecurity relies on effective information sharing  among network operators about indicator, hacks, and cyber  vulnerabilities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This committee has been central in its effort to foster  better cyber information sharing by producing bipartisan  cybersecurity legislation that President Obama signed into law  at the end of last year.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As you talked about it, the National  Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 authorizes the National  Cyber and Communications Integrity Center, NCCIC, within the  Department of Homeland Security as an information-sharing hub  for cybersecurity risk and incidents, and erected the NCCIC to  provide technical assistance, risk management support, and  incident response capabilities to impacted network operators."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The legislative proposal that the President unveiled last  month has again spurred debate.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Importantly, the  administration's proposal would require participating companies  to comply with certain privacy restrictions, such as removing  unnecessary personal information and taking measures to protect  any personal information to quality for liability protection."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In my view, the President's proposal has some merit."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As we go forward, we should consider the following  questions: First, what is being shared?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Is it just computer  code made up of zeros and ones, or does the information contain  Americans' sensitive personal data?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If it does contain personal  data, I believe that reasonable efforts should be made by  participating companies to remove personally identifiable  information from the information shared with the Government  that will help to preserve Americans' privacy."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Second, who is doing the sharing?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Is it a critical  infrastructure operator?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Third, where is the sharing happening?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The answer to the  question has privacy implications, particularly when the  sharing is between the Federal Government and the private  sector, as opposed to sharing between private-sector companies."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I look forward to hearing testimony from our witnesses on  the potential risks and rewards of a cyber information-sharing  environment dominated by ISAO, as the President envisions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Certainly, I would like to hear how the proposed changes could  impact NCCIC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The success of NCCIC is dependent on the  companies' seeing the value of proposition for sharing with the  Department.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I look forward to hearing from the Department on how they  intend to drive traffic to the NCCIC and how implementation of  a new cyber law is progressing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I would also like to hear more  about the new education grant program that the President has  proposed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While I am pleased that the President seems to agree about  the importance of making this investment in growing our cyber  workforce, I am disappointed that the proposal calls for just  $5 million a year to be spent over 5 years at 13 historically  black colleges and universities and two National laboratories  is disappointing, especially in light of a documented shortfall  in cyber workforce."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Given the billions of dollars spent on  cybersecurity, much of which is spent on Federal contractors, I  would have expected a more ambitious plan for developing cyber  tactics."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Before I close, I would like to note that on February 11,  together with the Chairman and the leadership of its Senate  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, we wrote  to the President about the new Cyber Threat Intelligence  Integration Center."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We look forward to a formal response to our  questions, particularly as they relate to the NCCIC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and  working with the Chairman on forthcoming legislation to help  ensure that the networks of our Nation's critical  infrastructure are more secure.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"With that, I yield back."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"[The statement of Ranking Member Thompson follows:]              Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson                            February 25, 2015     Over the past decade, we have witnessed an explosion of internet  use in all aspects of life."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As a Nation, we do more business on-line  than ever before--trillions of dollars a year."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For most Americans,  smartphones, tablets, and other computers have become the platforms on  which we live, work, and play."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Unfortunately, these devices and networks have also become targets  for bad actors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Last month's cyber attack on the Nation's second-largest health  insurer, Anthem, resulted in tens of millions of Social Security  numbers, birth dates, addresses, and names being stolen from its  database."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Given that Anthem insures 7.5 million people in 14 States,  the potential damage of this breach is expected to be extensive."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Last year's attack on Sony destroyed data, disabled thousands of  computers, and exposed the personal information of Sony employees."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,These attacks underscore that any network that is connected to the  internet is a potential victim.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The fact that our Nation's critical infrastructure--including the  power grid, financial institutions, and health care systems--are all  connected to the internet make them particularly attractive targets for  attack."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Cyber attackers are constantly probing for weaknesses in our  critical infrastructure which powers much of our electric grid,  financial institutions, and health care systems."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The attention that cybersecurity has received in recent years by  President Obama and Congress is reflective of the increasing awareness  that the responsibility to address this homeland security threat is a  collective one.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"At its core, cybersecurity relies on effective information sharing  among network operators about indicators, hacks, and cyber  vulnerabilities."

"
"

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Before I close, I would like to acknowledge that the committee just  met with the President's cybersecurity advisor, Michael Daniel."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I  appreciate Mr. Daniel's willingness to lay out the administration's  vision for cybersecurity and to address our questions, particularly  about the newly-announced cyber center that will be housed in the  intelligence community."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"On February 11, together with the Chairman and the leadership of  the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, we  wrote to the President about this new ``Cyber Threat Intelligence  Integration Center''."

CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman now recognizes the--I would like to briefly  introduce the witnesses.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"First, we have the Honorable Suzanne  Spaulding."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,She is the under secretary for the National  Protection and Programs Directorate at the Department of  Homeland Security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Next, we have Dr. Phyllis Schneck."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,She is a deputy under  secretary for cybersecurity and communications within the  National Protection and Programs Directorate at the Department  of Homeland Security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is great to have both of you here  today.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Finally, we have Dr. Eric Fischer, who is a senior  specialist for science and technology at the Congressional  Research Service."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The witnesses' full statements will appear in the record.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The Chairman now recognizes Ms. Spaulding for 5 minutes.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"STATEMENT OF SUZANNE E. SPAULDING, UNDER SECRETARY, NATIONAL      PROTECTION AND PROGRAMS DIRECTORATE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF                         HOMELAND SECURITY      Ms. Spaulding."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member  Thompson, Members of the committee."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We are very pleased to be here today to discuss the  administration's proposal to enhance cybersecurity information  sharing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This proposal recognizes the unique mission and  capabilities of the Department of Homeland Security's National  Protection and Programs Directorate.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It will facilitate  information sharing in ways that will significantly advance our  National security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"By placing the Department's National Cybersecurity and  Communications Integration Center, or NCCIC, as the  coordination center for receiving and disseminating cyber  threat indicator information, which will be very quickly  shared."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We will receive and disseminate that information to  Federal and non-Federal entities.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As this committee knows, we are faced with pervasive cyber  threats from a variety of actors, including nation-state  actors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"They are motivated by a range of objectives, including  espionage, political and ideological beliefs, and financial  gain."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The National Preparedness and Protection Directorate  focuses on helping our partners across Government and non- Government to manage those cyber risks, to reduce the frequency  and impact of cyber incidents, and to build their own capacity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We do this by sharing timely and accurate information and  analysis, particularly to enable the private and public-sector  partners to protect themselves."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This includes detailed analysis  about cascading consequences in the physical world that can  result from cyber incidents.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We provide technology to detect and block cyber threats  from impacting the dot.gov networks, the civilian Government  networks, and enable those agencies to more readily identify  network security issues and prioritize the actions that they  must take to address those."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We enable commercial cybersecurity companies to use  Government-furnished Classified information to better protect  their private-sector customers.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We provide on-site assistance  to critical infrastructure and Federal agencies who have been  impacted by a significant cyber incident.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We maintain a trusted  environment for private-sector partners to share information  and to collaborate to address cybersecurity threats and trends.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Congress' support for these activities led to the  bipartisan action last year to pass critical cybersecurity  legislation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That legislation enhanced our ability to work with  the private sector and with other Federal civilian departments.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As been noted, it strengthened the Department's ability to  recruit and to retain the kind of cybersecurity exerts that we  now have on-board."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Enactment of these bills represents significant progress in  the Department's cybersecurity mission.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I am very grateful to  Congress, to this committee, and particularly to Chairman  McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson, who contributed significant  efforts to ensure the enactment of this legislation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But we need to keep moving forward.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Additional legislation  is needed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Carefully updating laws to facilitate cybersecurity  information sharing is essential to improving the Nation's  cybersecurity.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While many companies currently do share  cybersecurity information with each other and with the  Government under existing laws, there is a growing need to  increase the volume and the speed of such information sharing,  without sacrificing the trust of the American people or  individual privacy and civil liberties."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The President's legislative proposal incentivizes private  entities to share information with the Government through that  National Cybersecurity and Integration Center, or NCCIC, that I  mentioned earlier."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That is our 24/7 operations and watch  center.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It brings together currently Government partners from  across the Government and the private sector.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This is  important.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The NCCIC's core mission, as stated in this committee's  unanimously-passed National Cybersecurity Protection Act, is  coordinating and serving as the interface for cybersecurity  information across the Government and the private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We do  this with strong protections in place for protecting privacy  and for protecting sensitive business information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Having a single designated entry point into the Government  makes it easier to ensure that privacy protections are being  consistently applied across the Government.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It reduces the  complexity for the private sector that wonders where to go.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It  improves our ability to develop a common operating picture of  the cyber threats that we see daily.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It helps us to connect the  dots, if you will, with regard to cyber threats."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I understand that Chairman McCaul has invited Members of  this committee to visit and tour our National Cybersecurity  Communications Integration Center.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I look forward to seeing  many of you there and continuing this discussion at that time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Before I close, I would like to reiterate Secretary  Johnson's comments on the Department's funding situation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Congress still has not passed a fiscal year 2015 appropriations  bill for the Department of Homeland Security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As long as we  operate on a continuing resolution, we are hampered by  uncertainty and the inability to fund vital new homeland  security initiatives."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Without funding, NPBD's cybersecurity and  critical infrastructure mission will be significantly impacted."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Let me end by saying that today, our adversaries can  exploit a fundamental asymmetry in our network infrastructure."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While nearly all of our systems and networks are globally  interconnected, our defensive capabilities are not yet."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This  gives the attacker a compelling advantage.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,They can find and  exploit weak links in our systems from anywhere around the  world at machine speed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"By sharing cyber threat indicators in  near real time, we can and will reduce that asymmetry."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I want to thank you for this opportunity to testify.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I look  forward to your questions.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I turn it over to my cyber deputy, Dr. Phyllis Schneck."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"[The joint prepared statement of Ms. Spaulding and Ms.  Schneck follows:]   Joint Prepared Statement of Suzanne E. Spaulding and Phyllis Schneck                            February 25, 2015                               introduction     Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and distinguished Members  of the committee, we are pleased to appear today to discuss the  President's cybersecurity legislative proposal on information sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In our testimony today, we will highlight the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) National Protection and Programs Directorate  cybersecurity role and capabilities, and describe how the President's  legislative proposal to facilitate cyber threat indicator information  sharing will further our National security, with DHS's National  Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) as the  coordination center to receive and disclose cyber threat indicators to  Federal and Non-Federal entities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"the on-going cyber threat and the dhs cybersecurity role     As a Nation, we are faced with pervasive cyber threats."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Malicious  actors, including those at nation-state level, are motivated by a  variety of reasons that include espionage, political and ideological  beliefs, and financial gain."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Increasingly, State, Local, Tribal and  Territorial (SLTT) networks are experiencing cyber activity of a  sophistication level similar to that seen on Federal networks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To achieve our cybersecurity mission, the National Protection and  Programs Directorate focuses on helping our partners understand and  manage cyber risk, reduce the frequency and impact of cyber incidents,  and build partner capacity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We share timely and accurate information  and analysis to enable private and public-sector partners to protect  themselves.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We provide on-site assistance to Federal agencies and  critical infrastructure entities impacted by a significant  cybersecurity incident.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We provide technology and services to detect  and block cyber threats from impacting Federal civilian networks.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We  enable Federal agencies to more readily identify network security  issues and take prioritized action.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We enable commercial cybersecurity  companies to use Classified information so they can better protect  their private-sector customers.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We perform comprehensive consequence  analyses that assess cross-sector interdependencies and cascading  effects, including the potential for kinetic harm that includes loss of  life, and we maintain a trusted environment for private-sector partners  to share information and collaborate on cybersecurity threats and  trends."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,DHS's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center     The NCCIC serves as a 24x7 centralized location for the  coordination and integration of cyber situational awareness and  incident management.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"NCCIC partners include all Federal departments and  agencies; State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; the  private sector; and international entities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The NCCIC continues to  explore opportunities to expand its liaison capacity from other  agencies and the private sector.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The NCCIC provides its partners with  enhanced situational awareness of cybersecurity and communications  incidents and risks, and provides timely information to manage  vulnerabilities, threats, and incidents."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In 2014, the NCCIC received  over 97,000 incident reports, and issued nearly 12,000 actionable cyber  alerts or warnings."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"NCCIC teams also detected over 64,000 significant  vulnerabilities on Federal and non-Federal systems and directly  responded to 115 significant cyber incidents."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The NCCIC actively shares cyber threat indicators to and from  multiple sources including private-sector partners, the intelligence  community, Federal Departments and agencies, law enforcement, State,  local, Tribal, and territorial governments, and international  governments."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This sharing, which has been taking place for many years,  takes many forms including person-to-person interactions on the NCCIC  floor, manual exchange of information via e-mail and secure web  portals, and more recently via automated, machine-to-machine exchanges  in STIX and TAXII protocols."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While all of these sharing methods have  value, the cybersecurity community has recognized the strategic  importance of migrating cyber threat indicator sharing to more  automated mechanisms when and where appropriate."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"cybersecurity legislation     Last year, Congress acted in a bipartisan manner to pass critical  cybersecurity legislation that enhanced the ability of the Department  of Homeland Security to work with the private sector and other Federal  civilian departments in each of their own cybersecurity activities, and  enhanced the Department's cyber workforce authorities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Enactment of  these bills represents a significant moment for the Department's  cybersecurity mission, and this committee in particular undertook  significant efforts to bring the bills to passage."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We are thankful for  your support and we are deploying those additional authorities with  clarity of mission.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Additional legislation is needed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We must take additional steps to  ensure that DHS is able to rapidly and efficiently deploy new  protective technologies across Federal civilian agency information  systems.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In addition, carefully updating laws to facilitate  cybersecurity information sharing within the private sector and between  the private and Government sectors is also essential to improving the  Nation's cybersecurity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While many companies currently share  cybersecurity threat information under existing laws, there is a  heightening need to increase the volume and speed of information shared  without sacrificing the trust of the American people or the protection  of privacy, confidentiality, civil rights, or civil liberties."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It is  essential to ensure that cyber threat information can be shared quickly  among trusted partners, including with law enforcement, so that network  owners and operators can take necessary steps to block threats and  avoid damage."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The NCCIC plays a critical role in the President's recent  legislative proposal because its core mission--as articulated in the  National Cybersecurity Protection Act, developed by this committee and  unanimously passed by the House in December--is to coordinate and serve  as an interface for cybersecurity information across the Government and  private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The Administration's Information-Sharing Proposal for Cyber Threat          Indicators     Building on the bipartisan cybersecurity legislation enacted last  Congress, President Obama visited the NCCIC on January 13, 2015, to  announce a proposal for additional legislation to improve cybersecurity  information sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The President noted, ``Much of our critical  infrastructure runs on networks connected to the Internet ."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,[a]nd  most of this infrastructure is owned and operated by the private  sector.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So neither Government nor the private sector can defend the  Nation alone.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It's going to have to be a shared mission--Government and  industry working hand in hand, as partners.''"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This partnership entails  sharing cyber threat indicators to better enable Government agencies  and the private sector to protect themselves.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Information sharing, especially of these technical ``threat  indicators'' that can be used to identify and block malicious activity,  is the lifeblood of effective cyber defense and response."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Pulling  together this information allows defenders to identify anomalies or  patterns and recognize dangerous activity before it can do significant  damage.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The goal of the President's proposal is to increase the sharing  of this type of information, as quickly as possible, with appropriate  protection for privacy and of sensitive information and systems."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Among other things, the administration's proposal would reduce the  risks for private entities to voluntarily share technical cyber threat  indicators with each other and the NCCIC by providing protections  against civil or criminal liability for such sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Equally  important, the proposal narrowly defines the threat indicators that  will be shared, requires that irrelevant identifying information be  minimized from these indicators, and generally requires strong  protections for the privacy and confidentiality of personal  information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Finally, the proposal calls for the creation of  Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,ISAOs would be  information sharing organizations that would help speed information  sharing within the private sector and between the private sector and  Government.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Our goal is to expand information sharing within the private  sector, and to build on the existing relationships, processes and  programs of the NCCIC to enhance cooperation between the Government and  private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The proposal will help us improve the methods that the  NCCIC already uses to share cyber threat indicators, and leverage  automation to achieve scalability wherever possible."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We look to evolve  and expand indicator sharing at the NCCIC from human exchanges,  portals, and written reports to automated machine-to-machine  communications."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Our vision is that this may reduce the time to receive  and act on indicators from hours to milliseconds, create consistency in  information provided to interagency partners, law enforcement, and the  private sector, and free analysts to focus on the threats that require  human analysis while expediting detection and blocking of new threats."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"NCCIC as the Coordination Center     Cyber threat indicators, which allow Government agencies and the  private sector to better protect themselves, come from a variety of  sources, including: Government agencies, private companies,  international partners, and ISAOs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Given the variety of formats used-- and information that is included--when sharing such information, the  Government must have a central clearinghouse to ensure that privacy and  confidentiality protections are consistently applied and that the right  information reaches the right Government and private-sector entities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"DHS is a leader within the Government when it comes to the  development and operational implementation of privacy, confidentiality,  and civil liberties policies."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,DHS was the first agency to have  statutorily established Officers for Privacy and for Civil Rights and  Civil Liberties.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"From its creation, DHS has built both privacy and  civil liberties protections into all of its programs and has dedicated,  on-site privacy professionals committed to ensuring that its cyber  mission is carried out in a way consistent with our Nation's values."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Through statutory protections like Protected Critical Infrastructure  Information (PCII), DHS will continue to anonymize the identity of  submitters and other proprietary and sensitive information in threat  indicator submissions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Moreover, the President's proposal calls for DHS  to build upon its existing privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberty  procedures by working with the Attorney General to develop new  procedures to appropriately limit Government receipt, use, and  retention of threat indicators."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Establishing the NCCIC as the primary  entry way for cyber threat indicators from the private sector will  ensure uniform application of these important privacy and  confidentiality protections, while still allowing cyber threat  indictors to be shared with law enforcement for the specific purposes  identified in the legislation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"NCCIC sits at the intersection of cyber communities, with  representatives from the private sector and other Government entities  physically present on the NCCIC floor and connected virtually."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This  diverse participation in the NCCIC was cemented by section 226(d) of  the Homeland Security Act as added by the National Cybersecurity  Protection Act.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,NCCIC's core mission is to enable better network  defense by assessing and appropriately sharing information on the risks  to America's critical cyber systems and how to reduce them.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"building capacity to accelerate automated sharing of cyber threat                                 indicators     The administration's proposal directs DHS to automate and share  information in as close to real time as practicable with relevant  Federal agencies, including law enforcement entities, and with ISAOs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For the past 3 years, DHS has led the development in collaboration with  the private sector of specifications--known as STIX and TAXII--which  standardize the representation and exchange of cyber threat  information, including actionable cyber threat indicators."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"STIX, the  Structured Threat Information eXpression, is a standardized format for  the representation and exchange of cyber threat information, including  indicators."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"TAXII, the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator  Information, is a standardized protocol for discovering and exchanging  cyber threat information in STIX."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The interagency Enhance Shared  Situational Awareness initiative has already chosen STIX as the basis  for sharing cyber threat indicators between the Federal cyber centers,  ensuring interoperability between these key sources of information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Through collaboration between DHS and the private sector, there is  a solid and rapidly-growing base of commercial offerings supporting  STIX and sharing indicators via the TAXII, including platforms, network  protection appliances and endpoint security tools."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While the NCCIC has  in-house systems and tools to assist analysts in generating STIX  indicators, those indicators are currently analyzed and filtered by  human analysts and shared back out with the private sector and Federal  partners through manual methods such as e-mail and secure portals."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In  2014, the NCCIC began a limited pilot with several organizations to  test automated delivery of STIX indicators via TAXII."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To inform our plan for achieving automated cyber threat indicator  information sharing, DHS created a working group between a range of DHS  offices and the FBI, a critical stakeholder in the NCCIC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We also  included experts from our Privacy, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties,  and Science and Technology offices, among others, to ensure that our  architecture is based on best-in-class technology and is consistent  with our values and our respect for Americans' privacy and civil  liberties."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Implementation will proceed through four major phases: (1) An  initial operating capability phase in which we will deploy a TAXII  system that can disseminate STIX cyber threat indicators with increased  automation capability, enabling the use of human analysis for the most  complex problems and egregious threats; (2) an expanded automation  phase in which we will develop and deploy DHS infrastructure that can  receive, filter, and analyze cyber threat indicators--during this  phase, we will promulgate guidance for private-sector companies to  minimize, redact, and tag their data prior to submission to NCCIC, and  will complete a Privacy Impact Assessment; (3) a final operating  capability phase in which we will fully automate DHS processes to  receive and appropriately disseminate cyber threat indicators in a  machine-readable format and finalize policies for filtering, receipt,  retention, use, and sharing, including regular compliance reviews; and  (4) a scaled services capability phase, during which DHS will work to  enable agencies that lack sufficient cybersecurity resources or  expertise to receive and share cyber threat indicators with the NCCIC  in near-real time by providing a turnkey technical solution to ``plug  in'' to the NCCIC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"dhs shares information widely with federal agencies and the private                                   sector     Currently, DHS shares information with Federal agencies and the  private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"DHS takes a customer-focused approach to information  sharing, and different types of information require differing response  times and dissemination protocols."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"DHS provides information to detect  and block cybersecurity attacks on Federal civilian agencies and shares  information to help critical infrastructure entities in their own  protection; provides information to commercial cybersecurity companies  so they can better protect their customers through the Enhanced  Cybersecurity Services program, or ECS; and maintains a trusted  information-sharing environment for private-sector partners to share  information and collaborate on cybersecurity threats and trends via a  program known as the Cyber Information Sharing and Collaboration  Program, or CISCP."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This trust derives in large part from our emphasis  on privacy, confidentiality, civil rights, and civil liberties across  all information-sharing programs, including special care to safeguard  personally identifiable information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,DHS also directly supports Federal civilian departments and  agencies in developing capabilities that will improve their own  cybersecurity posture.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Through the Continuous Diagnostics and  Mitigation (CDM) program, DHS enables Federal agencies to more readily  identify network security issues, including unauthorized and unmanaged  hardware and software; known vulnerabilities; weak configuration  settings; and potential insider attacks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Agencies can then prioritize  mitigation of these issues based upon potential consequences or  likelihood of exploitation by adversaries.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The CDM program provides  diagnostic sensors, tools, and dashboards that provide situational  awareness to individual agencies, and will provide DHS with summary  data to understand relative and system risk across the Executive  branch."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"DHS is moving aggressively to implement CDM across all Federal  civilian agencies, and Memoranda of Agreement with the CDM program  encompass over 97 percent of all Federal civilian personnel."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While CDM will identify vulnerabilities and systemic risks within  agency networks, the National Cybersecurity Protection System, also  known as EINSTEIN, detects and blocks threats at the perimeter of those  networks or at an agencies' Internet Service Provider."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"EINSTEIN is an  integrated intrusion detection, analysis, information-sharing, and  intrusion-prevention system."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The most recent iteration, Einstein 3  Accelerated (E3A), supplements EINSTEIN 2 by adding additional  intrusion prevention capabilities and enabling Internet Service  Providers (ISPs), under the direction of DHS, to detect and block known  or suspected cyber threats using indicators."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"conclusion     We are working together to find new and better ways to share  accurate, timely data in a manner consistent with fundamental American  values of privacy, confidentiality, and civil rights."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While securing  cyberspace has been identified as a core DHS mission since the 2010  Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, the Department's view of  cybersecurity has evolved to include a more holistic emphasis on  critical infrastructure which takes into account the convergence of  cyber and physical risk."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Today our adversaries exploit a fundamental asymmetry in our  network infrastructure: While nearly all of our systems and networks  are globally interconnected, our defensive capabilities are not."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This  gives the attackers a compelling advantage as they can find and exploit  the weak links in our systems from anywhere around the world--at  machine speed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"By sharing cyber threat indicators in near-real time, we  reduce that asymmetry."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As our defensive cybersecurity capabilities become more  interconnected, we greatly reduce the likelihood that an adversary can  re-use attack infrastructure, tools, tactics, techniques, and  procedures."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In addition, we greatly reduce the time window in which new  and novel attacks are effective because the ecosystem shares those  indicators and develops a type of ``herd immunity,'' improving defenses  as indicators are shared and events are correlated in near-real time."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"These two factors do not eliminate all cyber threats, but they hold the  promise of significantly increasing the time and resources (both  technical and human) that attackers must expend to achieve their goals."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Moreover, the STIX data format and the TAXII transport method are  increasingly compatible with commonly-used commercial information  technology (IT) products."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This means more entities are able to send  indicators automatically to the NCCIC, creating an ecosystem of  indicators which will in turn provide greater context to malicious  cyber activity and rapidly increase situational awareness per Executive  Order 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity and  Executive Order 13691, signed February 13, 2015, Promoting Private  Sector Cybersecurity Information Sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"DHS will continue to serve as one of the Government's primary  resources for information sharing and collaborative analysis, at  machine speed wherever possible, of global cyber risks, trends, and  incidents."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Through our leadership role in protecting civilian  Government systems and helping the private sector protect itself, DHS  can correlate data from diverse sources, in an anonymized and secure  manner, to maximize insights and inform effective risk mitigation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,DHS provides the foundation of the U.S. Government's approach to  securing and ensuring the resilience of civilian critical  infrastructure and essential services.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We look forward to continuing  the conversation and supporting the American goals of peace and  stability; in these endeavors, we rely upon your continued support."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and we look forward to  any questions you may have."

CHRG-114hhrg94108,The Chairman now recognizes Dr. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"STATEMENT OF PHYLLIS SCHNECK, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY,     CYBERSECURITY AND COMMUNICATIONS, NATIONAL PROTECTION AND     PROGRAMS DIRECTORATE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY      Ms. Schneck."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Good morning and thank you Chairman McCaul,  Ranking Member Thompson, and distinguished Members of the  committee."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Let me echo Under Secretary Spaulding's thanks for  convening this meeting today.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you for your tireless  support to our cyber mission and thank you for making it a  constant between my time in the private sector and my time now  in Government, the impact that our work and our legislative  process can have on good things."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The under secretary explained the Department of Homeland  Security's role and capabilities in cybersecurity and explained  why our National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration  Center, our NCCIC, is key and at the forefront of the  President's proposal for increasing the volume and speed of  information sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I would like to amplify that and tell you how we are going  to do this and how we are building that capability.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"First, to  the Ranking Member's question; what is being shared and what do  we need most?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We need information sharing and especially the  technical threat indicators; the bare bones information of, for  example, what is an address of a machine that is doing  something bad that we see?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What is the specific code of  software that is being sent to hurt good people?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"By identifying  these indicators, that is the life blood of cyber defense; by  being able to very quickly recognize them and put them  together."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Pulling together this information, it builds on the rules  of statistics."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We have to understand good behavior and bad  behavior to identify anomalies.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Identifying those anomalies at  the speed of machines will help us in our cyber defense  initiatives.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The President's proposal defines the kind of information,  specifically, that can be shared and requires very strong  protections around privacy and civil liberties to protect our  personal information and protect those privacy and civil  liberties and American ways of life that we seek to protect and  defend through our cybersecurity mission."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The proposal narrowly defines categories of technical  information used to define and mitigate these threats so that  we can then pull them together.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But it does not, for an  example, include exfiltrated information; which means the  information, for example, that someone might have tried to  steal, which could include proprietary information or someone's  private information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So very narrowly-defined information on  what we need to share and share quickly.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The President's ISAO Executive Order will enhance the  information-sharing efforts.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The order focuses specifically on  encouraging the formation effectiveness of information sharing  and analysis organizations.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"They can be profit or nonprofit,  private sector, and they can be composed of any combination of  public and private sectors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The Executive Order directs DHS to  strongly encourage the development of these formations to bring  people together in trusted relationships to share information  that transcends competition to enable those cyber threat  indicators to come together and show us, again at machine  speed, what enemy might be trying to hurt our systems and be  able to see at that 50,000-foot level all over the world what  actions are happening dispersed that we could use to protect  somebody right now."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,DHS--this is a very important point--is already sharing  information in real time with Federal agencies and the private  sector.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We share with people and machines using people and  machines.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We provide information to detect and block  cybersecurity threats to our Federal civilian government  agencies and, as the under secretary mentioned, within that,  using Government-Classified information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We also provide information to commercial companies so that  they can better protect themselves as well, also with some  systems using that Classified information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We maintain key  trusted information-sharing partnerships at a scientist level  and at policy levels with parts of the private sector so we can  enable us--ourselves and them to understand what is the science  and what are the key things we need to be looking for?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So trust  between people and machines.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Where are we going and why is this so important?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We need to  up our game to automate.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We need to take the machines and  remember that machines are not smart, they are just fast, and  use that very machine speed that the adversary uses to steal  and hurt us in our cyber systems and use that machine to  understand what is happening all over the world and enable our  machines in addition to other technologies to sense bad  behavior before it hurts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In doing that, part of that is pulling those automated  cyber threat indicators together so that we can start looking  at behavior all over the world and work--and this is very, very  important--in partnership."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So no one can do this alone.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We need  DHS, we need the FBI, we need the Secret Service, we need the  intelligence community, and we need the private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I thank you, Chairman, as well for all the work you have  done with the private sector to engage them with your committee  and how important it is to work with Government."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We have developed a common language and a common way of  writing cyber threat indicators so that anyone who wants to  share with us can, that can be transported at machine speed,  and that machines can readily read the information; and it  limits itself to what is required to be a cyber threat  indicator."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We need to continue to work with our privacy and  civil liberties experts constantly; with the FBI, with the  Secret Service, with law enforcement, with the intelligence  community to manage all the expectations and all of the  equities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But we are building protocols and structured language to  equalize and normalize with what a cyber threat indicator is,  to have the machines get a lot of the noise out of the way so  our top minds can look at the most egregious threats, and to  have our networks become more self-healing and more resilient."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Finally, I would like to reemphasize the importance of our  NCCIC, our National Cybersecurity Communications Integration  Center, and point out that that is the interface for sharing  cyber information across the Government and private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But  we do this in clear cooperation, and as we develop these  protocols, it is with the Secret Service and the FBI and all  the law enforcement and the intelligence community and the  private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This can't work if we do it alone.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It has to respect  everyone's equities and all privacy and civil liberties.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Having  that single designated entity in the Government reduces  complexity, as the under secretary stated and streamlines our  ability to develop that common picture of the threats we see  daily."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you for this opportunity to testify.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I look forward  to any questions you might have.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Just let me say that you have  really done an outstanding job standing up the NCCIC, bringing  the capabilities of the NCCIC to the current threats that we  have."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Your experience at McAfee is well-served.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I thank the  Department.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"With that, the Chairman now recognizes Dr. Fischer."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"STATEMENT OF ERIC A. FISCHER, SENIOR SPECIALIST, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY, CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS      Mr. Fischer."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Good afternoon, Chairman McCaul, Ranking  Member Thompson, and distinguished Members of the committee."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"On behalf of the Congressional Research Service, I would  like to thank you for the opportunity to testify today on  information sharing and cybersecurity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Barriers to sharing of  cybersecurity information are considered by many, as we heard,  to be a significant hindrance to effective protection of  information systems."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That is especially true for critical infrastructure, even  though most recent prominent cases of successful cyber attacks  have not involved such organizations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Many examples have been  cited of legal, technical, and other barriers."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In addition,  traditional approaches to security and confidentiality would  themselves impede sharing of information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,There is some disagreement among experts about whether  Federal legislation is needed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Nevertheless, there appears to  be a fairly broad consensus that legislation could be useful if  crafted appropriately."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, there is disagreement also  about what the key characteristics should be."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Proposals to  reduce or remove barriers have raised concerns, some of which  are related to the purpose of the barriers; that the barriers  are thought to currently impede sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"A key challenge appears to be how to achieve the proper  level of balance that fosters the sharing of useful information  efficiently and effectively, while ensuring avoidance of  adverse impacts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I will touch on five questions that the debate  has tended to focus on.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Question No.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,1: What are the kinds of information for which  barriers to sharing make effective cybersecurity more  difficult?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Information sharing can involve a wide variety of  materials communicated on a wide variety of time scales.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The  level of sensitivity of information can vary.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For example, it  may be Classified, proprietary, or personal, or open public  information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Information of any class will also vary in its  value for cybersecurity and the degree to which it needs human  processing to be useful.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To the extent that the goal of information sharing is to  defend information systems against cyber attacks, the focus has  been on actionable information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Such information may often need  to be shared very quickly, as Dr. Schneck has mentioned, with  little or no time for human examination."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Broader information contributing to shared situational  awareness may also be useful; for example, among companies  within a sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Such information might not be technically  actionable, but helps organizations to analyze their current  security postures and inform their responses."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"A key point is that addressing what should be shared, how  and when, is not as straightforward as it may seem."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This is  true not only for cybersecurity information, but more broadly  with security information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Question No.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,2: How should information sharing be  structured to ensure that it is efficient and effective?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Information sharing can conceivably lead to information  overload.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That can include not only information of uncertain  quality and use, but also similar or redundant information from  a variety of sources."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Various legislative proposals have approached the structure  information sharing differently.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The White House proposal would  use information sharing and analysis organizations, which were  created in the Homeland Security Act, but few of which appear  to exist today."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It might be useful to clarify the roles of  these and other entities as the committee considers  legislation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Question No.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"3: What are the risks to privacy rights and  civil liberties of individual citizens, and how are they best  protected?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Such concerns have been a significant source of  controversy and debate about information sharing and  legislation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"They have arisen in part because proposals would  permit sharing of specific information or specified information  by covered private entities, notwithstanding any other  provision of law."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That particular phrase has certain  implications that would be worthy of--perhaps of additional  consideration.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Now, the various legislative proposals address  privacy concerns in various ways, but there are also many  similarities among them."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Fourth question is: What, if any, statutory protections  against liability are needed?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Concerns about liability has  often been cited as a significant barrier to private-sector  information sharing, both with other private entities and with  the Federal Government."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"There are--in addition to the  notwithstanding provisions, there are also various proposals to  prohibit court actions to protect organizations against such  actions--or against liability concerns and reduce that barrier."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The fifth question, finally, is: What improvements to  current standards and practices are needed to ensure that  information sharing is useful and efficient for protecting  information systems, networks, and their contents?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As the other  witnesses have testified, standards for exchange of threat data  have been developed and their use is growing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But there are  also calls for additional standards and best practices.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"There  are some concerns among observers that such work is needed,  particularly with respect to--well, for example, evaluating the  effectiveness of information sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That concludes my testimony.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Once again, thank you for  asking me to appear before you today."

CHRG-114hhrg94108,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     While there is some disagreement among experts about whether  Federal legislation is needed to address the problem, there appears to  be fairly broad consensus that such legislation could be useful if  crafted appropriately but potentially harmful if not."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, there is  disagreement about what the key characteristics of useful legislation  would be."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Proposals to reduce or remove such barriers, including  provisions in legislative proposals in the last two Congresses, have  raised concerns, some of which are related to the purpose of barriers  that currently impede sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Examples include risks to individual  privacy and even free speech and other rights, use of information for  purposes other than cybersecurity, such as unrelated Government  regulatory actions, commercial exploitation of personal information, or  anticompetitive collusion among businesses that would currently violate  Federal law."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"More broadly, debate has tended to focus on questions such as the  following:     1."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What are the kinds of information for which barriers to sharing          exist that make effective cybersecurity more difficult, and          what are those barriers?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,2.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How should information sharing be structured in the public and          private sectors to ensure that it is efficient and effective?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,3.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What are the risks to privacy rights and civil liberties of          individual citizens associated with sharing different kinds of          cybersecurity information, and how can those rights and          liberties best be protected?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,4.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What, if any, statutory protections against liability are needed          to reduce disincentives for private-sector entities to share          cybersecurity information with each other and with Government          agencies, and how can the need to reduce such barriers best be          balanced against any risks to well-established protections?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,5.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What improvements to current standards and practices are needed          to ensure that information sharing is useful and efficient for          protecting information systems, networks, and their contents?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The White House information-sharing proposal would attempt to  address such questions in several ways.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The discussion below includes a  summary of how the proposal would address them in comparison to the  following bills addressing information sharing:H.R.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"234, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act          (CISPA), in the 114th Congress, identical to H.R."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"624 as passed          by the House in the 113th Congress;S. 2588, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2014          (CISA) as reported to the Senate in the 113th Congress;S. 456, the Cyber Threat Sharing Act of 2015, as introduced          in the 114th Congress."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"kinds of information shared     Information sharing can involve a wide variety of material  communicated on a wide range of time scales, ranging from broad  cybersecurity policies and principles to best practices to descriptions  of specific threats and vulnerabilities to computer-generated data  transmitted directly from one information system to another  electronically."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The level of sensitivity of information can also vary-- for example, it may be Classified, proprietary, or personal."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Information of any class will also vary in its value for cybersecurity  and the degree to which it needs human processing to be useful.\13\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \13\ See, for example, Kathleen M. Moriarty, ``Transforming  Expectations for Threat-Intelligence Sharing,'' RSA Perspective (August  3, 2013), https://www.emc.com/collateral/emc-perspective/h12175-transf- expect-for-threat-intell-sharing.pdf."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     To the extent that the goal of information sharing is to defend  information systems against cyber attacks, there appears to be a  consensus that shared information needs to be actionable--that is, it  should identify or evoke a specific response aimed at mitigating  cybersecurity risks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To be meaningfully actionable, information may  often need to be shared very quickly or even in an automated fashion."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"There may therefore be little or no time for human operators to examine  a specific parcel of data to determine whether sharing it could raise  privacy, liability, or other concerns."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The White House proposal would limit the scope of shared  information covered under the proposal to ``cyber threat indicators,''  which includes information needed to ``indicate, describe, or  identify'' malicious reconnaissance or command-and-control activities,  methods of social engineering and of defeating technical or operational  controls, and technical vulnerabilities, and from which ``reasonable  efforts'' have been made to remove personally identifying information  if the person is thought to be unrelated to the threat."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The definition  in S. 456 is largely identical.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The definition in the White House proposal and S. 456 are arguably  the narrowest in scope.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"S. 2588 also focuses on ``cyber threat  indicators,'' with a definition that is similar to that in the White  House proposal, but is somewhat broader, including other attributes,  such as the actual or potential harm caused by an incident."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It also  expressly permits sharing of information on countermeasures--measures  to prevent or mitigate threats and vulnerabilities.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,H.R.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"234 uses the term ``cyber threat information,'' characterized  as information ``directly pertaining to'' efforts to gain unauthorized  access to information systems or to effect negative impacts on systems  or networks, threats to the information security of a system or its  contents, and vulnerabilities of systems and networks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The bill also  defines a related term, ``cyber threat intelligence,'' with  characteristics similar to those of cyber threat information but is in  the possession of the intelligence community."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"structure of information sharing     Information sharing can conceivably lead to information overload,  where an entity receives much more information than it can reasonably  process."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That could include not only information of uncertain quality  and use, but also similar or redundant information from a variety of  sources."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In addition, a proliferation of sharing mechanisms could lead  to stovepiping, which could reduce sharing across sectors, for example,  and lack of clarity with respect to responsibilities, which could lead  to gaps in sharing useful information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In contrast, a narrow, tightly- defined structure for information sharing could lead to logjams or  impede innovation in response to continuing evolution of cyberspace."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The White House proposal and S. 456 would create a structure for  information sharing that includes the National Cybersecurity and  Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) as the Federal hub for  receipt and distribution of cybersecurity information, and fostering  the use of private information sharing and analysis organizations  (ISAOs) as recipients of information from private entities.\14\ ISAOs  could presumably also share such information under the provisions of  the Homeland Security Act, but the proposal does not specifically  address that function for them."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The proposal would require the DHS  Secretary to ensure that indicators are shared in a timely fashion with  other Federal agencies.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,S. 456 would require that procedures for such  sharing be established and would specifically require the Secretary to  ensure that both useful Classified and Unclassified information is  shared with non-Federal entities.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \14\ ISAOs were defined in the Homeland Security Act (6 U.S.C.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"  131(5)) as entities that gather and analyze information relating to the  security of critical infrastructure, communicate such information to  help with defense against and recovery from incidents, and disseminate  such information to any entities that might assist in carrying out  those goals."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The proposal covers receipt of indicators by ISAOs but  does not mention communication or dissemination of information by them,  except, by inference, to the NCCIC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Information Sharing and Analysis  Centers (ISACs) are more familiar to most observers.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"They may also be  ISAOs but are not the same, having been originally formed pursuant to a  1998 Presidential directive (The White House, ``Presidential Decision  Directive 63: Critical Infrastructure Protection,'' May 22, 1998,  http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd/pdd-63.htm)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     H.R.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,234 would create an entity at DHS (presumably the NCCIC \15\)  to share threat information and an entity at the Department of Justice  to share cyber crime information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It would require individual agencies  that receive threat information to develop procedures for sharing it.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In contrast to S. 456, it would require the Director of National  Intelligence to establish procedures for sharing Classified threat  information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It would also designate specific classes of private-sector  entities as those permitted to monitor systems and share threat  information under the bill.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Those include entities that provide  cybersecurity goods and services to others or to themselves.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \15\ The text in the bill was originally drafted before the  enactment of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration  Center Act of 2014 (Pub.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,L. No.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"113-282), which established the NCCIC  by statute."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     S. 2588 would require DHS to create a ``capability and process''  for sharing both threat indicators and countermeasures.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It would  establish an interagency process to develop procedures for sharing  Federal information with the private sector.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It would require  development of an interagency process for sharing Classified threat  indicators.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,timeliness of sharing     The time scale on which shared information will be most useful  varies.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That is especially an issue in an environment where the  relevance of timing for shared information may be measured in seconds  or even milliseconds in many cases.\16\ The White House proposal and S.  456 would address this concern by requiring the NCCIC to share  indicators ``in as close to real time as practicable'' and by requiring  establishment of a program to advance automated mechanisms for such  sharing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \16\ See, for example, M.J."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     H.R.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,234 and S. 2588 would also require ``real-time sharing.''
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The  meaning of this term is not explicitly defined or described in the  bills, but it presumably refers to sharing that occurs rapidly, for  example, by machine-to-machine transmission."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That is consistent with  the stated purposes of the legislative proposals, in that threat  information would likely need to be disseminated quickly in order to  detect or prevent incoming cyber attacks, which can occur very quickly."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This raises the question of whether this term should require any  particular mode of sharing, for example, by machine-to-machine  transmission without or with minimal intervening processing by human  operators, and how different interpretations of the term may impact  operational effectiveness, privacy interests, and competition for  technical and financial resources."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The White House proposal appears to  address that through its proposed development of automated mechanisms,  and S. 2588 would require development of a process to receive  indicators and countermeasures electronically, including via an  ``automated process between information systems.''"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"privacy and civil liberties     Concerns relating to privacy and civil liberties, especially the  protection of personal and proprietary information and uses of shared  information, have been a significant source of controversy in debate  about information-sharing legislation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Such concerns have arisen in  part because the White House proposal and the bills would permit  sharing of specified cybersecurity information by covered private  entities ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.''
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That would  arguably remove barriers to sharing stemming from concerns that  information would inadvertently violate laws such as those on privacy  and anti-trust.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, it also raises concerns about privacy and civil liberties."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In particular, personally identifying information might be included in  the shared information but might not be related to the threat."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In  addition, data analytics might conceivably be used to draw inferences  about identity from data sets even if any given piece of the shared  information would not be identifying."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Second, if access to shared  information is not strictly controlled and restricted, or is used for  purposes other than cybersecurity, risks to civil liberties may arise."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Concerns have also been raised about regulatory use of shared  information and disclosure of proprietary business information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The White House proposal would address such concerns by:limiting application of the ``notwithstanding'' provision to          indicators disclosed to the NCCIC and ISAOs;limiting private-sector use of shared indicators to purposes          relating to protection of information systems and their          contents;requiring minimization of personally identifiable          information and safeguarding of any such information that          cannot be removed;requiring development of guidelines by the Attorney General          on limiting the acquisition and sharing of personally          identifiable information and establishing processes for          anonymization, safeguarding, and destruction of information;exempting information received by the Federal Government          from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act;prohibiting use of shared information for regulatory          enforcement;requiring penalties for Federal violations of its          restrictions relating to information sharing; andan annual report to Congress on privacy and civil liberties."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,S. 456 includes those provisions but would also permit a private  entity to receive indicators under the ``notwithstanding'' provision.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,H.R.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,234 and S. 2588 have related provisions except as follows:  Both bills explicitly limit Federal use of shared information to  cybersecurity purposes and uses relating to protection of individuals  and investigation and prosecution of cyber crimes and certain other  offenses.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,They both require various activities to reduce the degree to  which personal information is shared and other means of safeguarding it  from unauthorized sharing and use.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,H.R.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,234 requires that guidelines be  developed through an interagency process.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"liability protections     Concern about liability has often been cited as a significant  barrier to private-sector sharing of cybersecurity information, both  with other private entities and with the Federal Government."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In  addition to the protections granted by the use of ``notwithstanding any  other provision of law'' with respect to provision of information by  private-sector entities, the White House proposal would address this  issue by prohibiting civil or criminal actions in Federal or State  courts for covered activities with respect to lawfully obtained cyber  threat indicators disclosed to or received from the NCCIC or a  certified ISAO."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, it also specifies monopolistic actions such as  price fixing that are not permitted."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The prohibition on civil or criminal actions in H.R.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"234 covers  acquisition and sharing of cyber threat information, or decisions for  cybersecurity purposes based on such information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The bill stipulates  that actions must be taken in good faith.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The S. 2588 prohibition  covers only private defendants, and includes monitoring systems or  sharing information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,S. 2588 states that a good-faith reliance that an  activity was permitted under the bill's provisions will serve as a  complete defense against any court action.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It also stipulates that  private-sector exchange of cyber threat information or assistance for  cybersecurity purposes does not violate anti-trust laws, but further  specifies monopolistic actions such as price-fixing that are not  permitted."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,improvements to standards and practices     The concerns discussed above about what information would be most  useful to share and how raise the question of whether better standards  and best practices are needed for improving the effectiveness and  efficiency of information sharing.\17\ The White House proposal and S.  456 would require the DHS Secretary to establish a process for  selecting a private entity that would determine best practices for  creating and operating private ISAOs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The recent Executive Order on  information sharing has a similar provision.\18\ There are no similar  provisions in the other bills.

CHRG-114hhrg94108,I now recognize myself for questions.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Ms. Spaulding, I think as you mentioned, we have  extraordinary offensive capabilities that we--you and I have  seen and Dr. Schneck."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That kind of capability turned against us  could be very destructive.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is the defensive capability that  I think is where we are trying to improve here through  additional legislation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I am very proud of this committee's work last Congress in  passing really the first cybersecurity legislation, landmark  cybersecurity legislation, that I think the Ranking Member--I  can speak for him as well--is both pro-security but pro- privacy."
"

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, I am not talking about you."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I am  talking about the pro-privacy and pro-security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"You know, as I have studied this--and I have studied it  extensively--it seems to me that there is--the Department of  Homeland Security is really the ideal place for the safe  harbor."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is the civilian interface to the private sector.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It  also has a robust privacy office and can protect personal  information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Some would argue it should be another portal in the Federal  Government.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I think that the safe harbor at DHS is--again,  should be the lead portal, if you will, for the sharing of this  information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But there are other opinions on that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I wanted to elicit  first from Dr. Schneck and Ms. Spaulding, what are your  thoughts on how to integrate the other portals that exist  today?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We have, of course, NSA, the intelligence community, we  have Treasury Department that the financial world, as I talk to  people in that sector seem to--they like that portal, as well."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I know that you would be taking it--you know, information from  the intelligence community, FBI, and other agencies to  basically funnel that threat information through the DHS  civilian interface."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But can you speak to these other portals and how they  factor into the President's proposal and what do you think  would be the best idea here?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"First, I think it is really important to emphasize what  this legislation does and does not cover."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So this is narrowly  focused on network defense and the kind of information that is  most important for specifically defending networks; and that is  this cyber threat indicator information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It is in no way  intended to get in the way of existing relationships that  companies might have today with other parts of the Federal  Government, whether it is the FBI or Treasury or elsewhere in  the Federal Government."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Calls to say we think we see something odd going on in our  system should continue to be made wherever those companies are  most comfortable going in.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We have mechanisms in place to  ensure that a call to one is effectively and appropriately a  call to all; and that we put together the appropriate  interagency teams to respond to those kinds of requests for  assistance and information coming in.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So this is by no means intended to cover all kinds of  information sharing between the private sector and the  Government.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Those relationships are very important.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think that is an important point.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,As I  talk to the private sector--and it is very important to me to  have their buy-in on this--I think that is a very important  point to make; is that we are not saying you can't have contact  with these other portals.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It is just that DHS is, you know, the  lead interface."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Dr. Schneck, do you have any thoughts on that?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.

CHRG-114hhrg94108,But we are working  constantly with our partners to make sure that no one is  deprived of any information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That is what takes so long.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is  not just a technology problem.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This is a policy puzzle of how  do we preserve the privacy, civil liberties, and equities,  continue to maintain all the existing relationships and make  sure information gets to the right people at the right time at  light speed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Let me just echo the comments made  earlier, and that is that in the last 5 years, I have seen the  capabilities at Homeland Security go way up."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The sharing of  this threat information in real time has increased  exponentially, I think, under your leadership."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That makes a  difference.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Because there were doubters, you know, 5 years ago  about whether DHS could stand up and have that capability."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I  think you have demonstrated and proved that they can.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So last question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, I have two quick ones."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But on the  liability protection, I commend the Secretary for coming  forward with this piece."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is sometimes a bone of contention  between both sides of the aisle.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But I think it is absolutely  essential to incentivize the private sector to participate in  the safe harbor; for without that, they will not do so."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I think  they have to have the assurance that if they share information,  they are not open to a lawsuit."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So I have talked to the private sector.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,They like the  liability protections that are presented here.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think they  have some concern about private-to-private sharing and the  certification process and all this.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How would that work under  this proposal?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So the liability protections, as you know,  apply not only to sharing of these cyber threat indicators with  the NCCIC, with the Department of Homeland Security, but also  to sharing with these information sharing and analysis  organizations, these--we call them ISAOs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Many of those are the  ISACs that exist today for the various sectors; the financial  services ISAC, the multi-State ISAC, and others."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So what the legislation provides is that the private sector  can share among themselves through these appropriate  organizations and enjoy the same liability protection for  providing that information to those organizations.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think the safe harbor at DHS is a  construct within--where we want to incentivize most of the  sharing of information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But I do think the private sector's  private-to-private sharing also should be protected as well.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We  can discuss that more as this legislation unfolds.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Last question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I get asked this question probably the most.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That is, you know, what keeps you up at night?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I talk about  cybersecurity quite a bit.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But within this space, to both Ms.  Spaulding and Dr. Schneck, what keeps you up at night the most?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So clearly, what I worry most about is cyber  activity that would significantly disrupt our critical  infrastructure."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So we spend a lot of time thinking about those  consequences and making sure we understand interdependencies  within the physical world.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Because this is not just about  protecting machines, this is about protecting our ways of life."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So we need to make sure that we understand what are those  consequences that would be most devastating, and that we are  working most closely with those parts of our critical  infrastructure to make sure that we can mitigate those  consequences and try to prevent, as Dr. Schneck said, bad  things--bad things from doing bad harm."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Dr. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I would echo the interface of the  physical world.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,No one ever tried to keep a machine safe to  keep a machine safe.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Our job at Homeland Security is to keep  people safe.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The Secretary always tells us that cybersecurity  is a key part of homeland security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Another piece that really does keep me up at night as well  is our small-to-medium business and our State and local.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,They  don't typically have enough budget to focus on cybersecurity.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Part of the elegance that will come from our teamwork with our  partners and the FBI and the intelligence community and across  the private sector and Government is to pull those threat  indicators together to be able to, in final phases, make them  available to the greater 99 percent of our business fabric that  is not a big company and to our State and locals, and to have  that system learn by participating and make all of us smarter  and safer."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If I would just add, I thank you for your gracious comments  about my leadership earlier."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I think about the team back at the  NCCIC and back across DHS that really makes it happen, and I  want you to know about that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I walked into the finest team on  the planet.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, thank you."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Your boss just arrived.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I  want to recognize the Secretary.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I will reiterate my comments  about Ms. Spaulding and Dr. Schneck and their tremendous  performance in standing up DHS with the capabilities with the  respect it deserves, and I think the ability to move forward  with the proposal from you, sir."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I also commended you before you came in on your proposal of  liability protection, which I think will incentivize the  private sector to fully participate in this safe harbor."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So  thank you for your leadership.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,You got two really good  employees right here.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So with that, the Chairman now recognizes the Ranking  Member."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Thompson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Very rarely do we agree 100 percent on anything.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But the  two employees referenced here today absolutely have  distinguished themselves.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Not just here, but in their careers  in general."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I would like unanimous consent to have entered into the  record the letter that you co-authored with me and our  colleagues on the Senate to the President referencing some  concerns we had about the new cyber center.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Without objection, it is ordered."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"[The information follows:]   Letter Submitted for the Record by Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson                                  February 11, 2015."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The Honorable Barack Obama, President of The United States, The White House, Washington, DC 20500."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Dear Mr. President: Thank you for your dedication and leadership on  the important national and economic security issue of cybersecurity.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As  the leaders of the Committees that developed legislation to codify the  Department of Homeland Security's role as the lead Federal agency for  helping to protect private sector networks, principally through the  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC),  we have several questions regarding your newly-unveiled proposal for a  new cybersecurity information integration center."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We were pleased that you signed ``National Cybersecurity Protection  Act of 2014'' (P.L.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"113-282) into law less than two months ago, on  December 18th, and implementation of that law is underway."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"At this  time, the NCCIC, with its newly codified authority, is working to  establish itself as an effective partner with the private sector to  meet evolving cybersecurity challenges."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Pursuant to the ``National  Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014,'' among the functions of the  NCCIC are the following:     ``(1) being a Federal civilian interface for the multi-directional          and cross-sector sharing of information related to          cybersecurity risks, incidents, analysis, and warnings for          Federal and non-Federal entities;     ``(2) providing shared situational awareness to enable real-time,          integrated, and operational actions across the Federal          Government and non-Federal entities to address cybersecurity          risks and incidents to Federal and non-Federal entities;     ``(3) coordinating the sharing of information related to          cybersecurity risks and incidents across the Federal          Government;''     Additionally, the NCCIC is ``a 24/7 cyber situational awareness,  incident response, and management center that is a national nexus of  cyber and communications integration for the Federal government,  intelligence community, and law enforcement.''"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We understand that  increasing private sector participation and improving the quantity and  quality of information received at this Federal civilian center was a  priority for you, as it is for us and DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Therefore, we have questions about your new proposal to establish  another information sharing hub, the Cyber Threat Intelligence  Integration Center (CTIIC) that was unveiled this week, as the  activities outlined for the center seem to resemble the functions  authorized in law for the NCCIC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We are concerned that the introduction  of the CTIIC at this moment in the NCCIC's evolution may complicate  those efforts and introduce uncertainty for the private sector and  other partners.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It also risks driving away activity to the new CTIIC,  which would be operated by the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence (ODNI)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Accordingly, we request that you please answer the following  questions:Why is the CTIIC needed at this time?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How is it supposed to          differ from the NCCIC?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Do you intend to submit a legislative          proposal to Congress to authorize this center?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If so, when?Some have observed that functions of the CTIIC are          duplicative with those of the NCCIC.\1\ Others have said that          it introduces unnecessary bureaucracy.\2\ Is the CTIIC          duplicative?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Specifically, what are the responsibilities and          activities of the CTIIC and are they already covered by the          NCCIC or, for that matter, the FBI's cyber center?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ Sean Lyngaas, ``New Cyber Agency Modeled on Counterterrorism  Center,'' FEDERAL COMPUTER WEEK (FCW), February 10, 2015, wrote that  Chris Cummiskey, the former DHS under secretary for management, said  his first reaction to the news of the CTIIC's establishment was that  ``its prescribed functions sounded quite a bit like NCCIC's.''"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"\2\ Melissa Hathaway, former White House cybersecurity coordinator  and president of Hathaway Global Strategies told Ellen Nakashima in  ``New Agency to Sniff Out Threats in Cyberspace,'' WASHINGTON POST,  February 10, 2015, that said ``We should not be creating more  organizations and bureaucracy ."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,we need to be forcing the existing  organizations to become more effective--hold them accountable.''
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Further, Stephen Cobb, a security researcher at ESET North America,  told National Public Radio's Marketplace Tech that ``the only real  difference between NCCIC and CTIIC is that NCCIC reports to the  Department of Homeland Security, whereas the new agency answers to the  Office of Director of National Intelligence,'' at http:// www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/two-cybersecurity-agencies-diverged- wood."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------Why are you establishing this center at the ODNI,          particularly in light of your longstanding interest in          bolstering DHS as the interface for the private sector on          cybersecurity?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What interactions will the new center have with          the private sector?Given that the CTIIC will be housed in the Intelligence          Community, please explain how it will relate to the National          Security Agency and the degree to which it will be involved in          the collection of intelligence?As you roll out this new center, how do you plan to ensure          that the private sector shares timely cyber threat information          with the statutorily-authorized NCCIC?To what degree does the effectiveness of the CTIIC depend on          enactment of information-sharing legislation?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The protections          for personally identifiable information are well-established          with respect to private sector information sharing at the          NCCIC.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What, if any, privacy protections would be required for          information sharing with the CTIIC?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As partners in efforts to bolster the nation's cyber posture, we  have a keen interest in ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the  Federal government's efforts and seek opportunities to minimize  duplication and get the best results for our money."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, in advance, for your timely response to our questions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Should you or other members of your team need to follow up on this  request, please feel free to contact Hope Goins, Chief Counsel for  Oversight (Committee on Homeland Security, Minority), Brett DeWitt,  Senior Policy Advisor for Cybersecurity (Committee on Homeland  Security, Majority), Matt Grote, Senior Professional Staff Member  (Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Minority)  or William McKenna, Chief Counsel for Homeland Security (Senate  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Majority)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Sincerely,                                         Bennie G. Thompson,                     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Thompson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Ms. Spaulding, I referenced the letter in my opening  statements."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I would hope that at some point we will have an  answer back on that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you very much.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In 3 days, unless a miracle happens, we will be, as a  Department, out of money."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We have talked here about the cyber  threat and what that means to this country, what keeps us up at  night and all of that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Ms. Spaulding, can you enlighten the Members of this  committee, if 3 days come and DHS is without money to go  forward, what that would mean for our cyber defense here?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Absolutely, Ranking Member Thompson."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank  you, and let me just reassure you that we are working  diligently on the response to your letter, and it will arrive  promptly."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is a priority of the Secretary's that we be prompt  in our response to Congressional inquires.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This is one we take  particularly seriously.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We will get back to you very quickly on  that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"With regard to the impact of a potential funding hiatus, I  can say it will--as I said in my testimony, it will have an  impact on our cyber mission."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Let me give you a few examples.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So  we are in the process of deploying the latest iteration of our  sensors in the dot.gov, in our civilian government networks and  systems."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That is our Einstein program.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This is Einstein 3A,  which is the technology that will help us not just detect, but  block the intrusions coming in; and Einstein 2, which is the  detection capability."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,These activities of rolling this out will have to stop in  the event of a funding hiatus.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I will say a week of stoppage we  could probably make up.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But with each week that continues, that  is another couple of agencies that are not brought on-board and  receiving the protection at a time when the adversary is not  taking any break in their efforts to penetrate our civilian  government systems."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Our other dot.gov technologies is our continuous  diagnostics and mitigation program, which looks inside that  civilian government networks and systems to look at their  health."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That--deployment of that also will be delayed if we  have a funding hiatus.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That has an impact on our ability to  quickly address--identify and address vulnerabilities like the  JASBUG vulnerability that has been most recently in the media.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"With regard to our enhanced cybersecurity services program,  where we make sensitive Government and Classified information  available to cybersecurity providers to better protect private- sector companies, the on-boarding of new providers will be  delayed if we have a funding hiatus."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So our ability to protect  critical infrastructure owners and operators will be impacted.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"On the communications side, our ability to keep up with the  next generation of communication technologies that the private  sector is going full-speed-ahead to implement, our ability to  continue to provide priority interoperable communication for  National security and emergency response will be impacted, will  be delayed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As I say, in the mean time, the private sector is  rolling out that new technology."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If we don't keep up, we will  not be able to provide that prioritized interoperable  communications that is so essential."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Thompson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, thank you very much."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"A follow-up to  that, all of us want to work with the business community."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What  constraints would a lack of money impact the Department's work  in interfacing from a cyber standpoint with the business  community?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So the work we do on a daily basis to build  those essential trusted relationships would be put on hold.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"All  of that outreach, we are--have done a campaign across the  country, for example, to educate critical infrastructure owners  and operators about threats to their industrial control systems  in cyber space."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Critically important; you asked what keeps me  awake at night, those are the kinds of things that do."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Those  activities would not be able to continue.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The guidance from the President, the direction to the  President to have--for the Department to set up the standards  body to facilitate the establishment of these appropriate  information-sharing mechanisms between private-sector entities,  these information sharing and analysis organizations, our  ability to issue that grant and get that going forward would be  hampered by both a continuing resolution and certainly by a  funding hiatus."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Thompson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I yield back.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Let me just say for myself that I don't  think we should be playing politics with the National Security  Agency, given the high-threat environment that we are in today,  both from a cybersecurity standpoint and also from al-Qaeda and  ISIS, as well."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I certainly hope that Congress can resolve this  and avoid a shutdown of the Department.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"With that, the Chairman now recognizes Mr. Clawson."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you for coming today and for your  service.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you--both of y'all for holding this important  session.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So I imagine myself on the top of a large multi-national  company.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I have got employee--I have got stakeholders all over  the world, a board of directors that is not all Americans."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I  have got an ERP system, maybe it is--could be Triton Bond,  could be Oracle, could be--you know, could be SAP, could be  anything."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I have worked years to get it integrated around the  world.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Factories everywhere.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I accept that cybersecurity is an  important public good, and that if we don't have it, we are  dead."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I also accept that the liability insurance that you y'all  talk about here protects one stakeholder, and that is the  shareholder."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But my world is much more complicated.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I have data centers,  regional data centers, all over the world, with customers and  suppliers integrated in those data centers."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Now as CEO, I am  gonna go out and say look, y'all, in the name of cybersecurity  for the world, but mainly for America, we are gonna start  sharing data."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"You kind of have to trust us on what we are gonna  share, when we are gonna share it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The devil will be in the  details actually.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We are gonna--you know, those specifics will  be defined later."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But don't worry, none of this data will get  into the wrong hands; your privacy will not be violated, even  though you grew up in the Czech Republic or Russia, where they  were spied upon their whole lives, and the last thing they want  is another big brother."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It feels to me like y'all got a tough sale.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It feels to me  liability insurance or not, that my world is all about multiple  stakeholders."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It is not just about profit; big, bad  corporations making more money."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We are trying to protect our  customers, our suppliers, the communities that we live in."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What  I have read so far about what y'all propose just doesn't feel  like a very compelling case that I can take to my multi- national board of directors.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What am I missing, and what data can you give to make this  more palatable?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Because if you can't get me, I know what my  friends back in the private sector are gonna say."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is not  just about profit.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Go ahead.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"No, Congressman, you have very well  articulated the concerns that we hear when we are out talking  to our partners in the private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,You are absolutely  right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,There is a wide range of reasons that companies have-- legitimate reasons--for having concerns about sharing  information with the Government.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is not just lack--it is not lack of  patriotism.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"No, I totally agree."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Throughout my  career, interacting with CEOs of companies, I find them to be  an extremely patriotic bunch."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So I absolutely agree.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I will say, with respect to this legislative proposal and  the sharing of cyber threat indicator information, you are  correct, the devil is in the details."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The good news is that as  we move to automated information sharing, those details will be  apparent."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,There will be total transparency about the specific  kinds of information that we are seeking and receiving.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Because we are creating a structured way of presenting that  information that will detail very specifically the kind of  information that we want to get.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We will also work through the  policy and protocols for protecting that sensitive information,  both in terms of proprietary information and privacy  information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So those things will be transparent.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Can you imagine if, in one of the countries  that I operate in, the government of that country telling me  that I had to share this same sort of information?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How would we  respond?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Again, I--think the--limiting this to cyber  threat indicator information, which is fairly technical  information about the IP addresses that are sending malware,  for example, to disrupt equipment, this is the kind of  information that is less sensitive."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Each company will make its  own decisions.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think you are right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"One of the things we have tried to be clear about, this is  not a silver bullet, this is not a panacea, this is not gonna  make every company open its doors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But it does address concerns  that we have heard from the private sector.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,There will be a  fair amount of detail about precisely what we are talking about  sharing here.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The legislation defines it fairly----     Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I think that without that detail, any private- sector CEO would be negligent to go along on the basis of  trust."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Dr. Schneck, would you like to answer  that?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Yes, very briefly."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So I was in a very large  company about 18 months ago.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I hear you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I lived that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I was  not at the level you describe.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But I was a key technology  officer for the global government.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I was the one that shared  information or didn't.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I was the subject of a storied phone  call from a former FBI executive and executive assistant  director, three down from the top, who I consider a very close  friend, who yelled at me at 11:00 at night on my home phone  because he found out something he didn't know, and I couldn't  share it with him."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We are going to have to earn your trust.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This sharing is  not required.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is my scientific belief that there will be  benefits in getting our data.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,You don't have to give anything  at first to get it.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I think what the under secretary points out  is very important, it is key."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,These are just scientific  indicators.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But you--the companies will see that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We will work  to earn your trust.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is voluntary.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I am nonpartisan on this issue.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Anything I can  do to help you, you know, with my background, I urge you to  seek me out."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I am always worried about people on the telephone.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I am even more worried about people in my ERP system.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So with  that as a starting point, y'all--you know, use--anything I can  do to help, I am here."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you very much, Congressman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We will  definitely take you up on that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If the gentleman would yield, we do have a  field trip, if you will, to the NCCIC facility."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I would  encourage you to attend that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think it is important to note  also this is not a mandatory sharing system.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is voluntary.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This authorization that we authorized the Department's cyber  operations last Congress had the support of industry, the  chamber, the privacy groups."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,All I think in moving forward what we want to do is provide  liability protection so that they can fully participate.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Because I think there is a reluctance, as you point out."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Because you have a duty to the shareholders to not want to  participate until you have that assurance that you wouldn't  open yourself up to a lawsuit.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So I look forward to you--you  obviously have tremendous experience on this issue.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I look  forward to working with you on this.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Chairman recognizes the gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Jackson  Lee."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Jackson Lee.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Mr. Chairman, thank you very much."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I might  say to my good friend, Mr. Clawson, with his experience but  also his demeanor."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I truly believe that we have common ground  on these very important issues.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I gave an old story that I hope will be very brief.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I  indicated that when I chaired the transportation security  committee, we had included infrastructure, which was then  cybersecurity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The point was that it was all embracing an  infrastructure that we had not yet hit, if you will, the  epicenter of fear and epicenter of hacking."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But we did look at  the infrastructures that are governed by cybersecurity and  realized that we were vulnerable.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So I want to thank all of you for bringing us up into the  21st Century as it relates to home homeland security and this  very crucial issue.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I want to add my appreciation for those of  you who have come from the private sector for serving your  Nation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Let me acknowledge the Secretary in his absence and thank  him for being, as he has indicated, everywhere and all over on  the basis of National security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I want to thank the Chairman of this full committee.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I hope  that his efforts will be heard in his Republican conference  that we should be dealing with National security and not  political security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Clearly, on the issue of where we are in  this time and date and what we are facing, I can't imagine a  more important component."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,There are many important components  at DHS.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But certainly, what we are discussing today has far- reaching impact."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So I want to just take the words that were presented when  the President offered his thoughts on January 13 and he said  when public and private networks are facing an unprecedented  threat from rogue hackers, as well as organized crime and even  state actors, the President is, of course, unveiling the next  steps in his plan to defend the Nation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"At that time, then he unveiled the White House proposal."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That is, of course, the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration  Center."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Many of you know that we have worked so hard on the  efforts to have the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So my questions are going to be--I know we had some earlier  discussions--the pointed synergism, if you will, of those two  entities and the concern about confusion between the broader  public."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"My interpretation--I have some privacy questions--is  that the CTIIC will be not gathering, but analyzing; will be  the high-level threat entity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"My concern is, will that  information of their analysis be accessible to DHS, Members of  the respective homeland security committees?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Because it looks  as if there is an attempt to put a wall between the very agency  that then has to act on trying to save the Nation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Then, of course, the NCCIC will be the face to the private  sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We will have to engender their trust.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"They will have to  know well, this is an agency that can help me, or do I need to  try to bang down the doors of the CTIIC, even though that is  not the intent?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So let me just end right there so that I can ask you, Madam  Secretary Spaulding, our Ranking Member gave you the  opportunity for a long litany."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Let me for the record speak to  this defunding or no funding of Department of Homeland Security  in the backdrop of--let me try not to use the word ``crisis''-- but the increasing threats that are viable through hacking,  through other efforts as it relates to security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Does this put us, the Department of Homeland Security and  the security of this Nation, in a position of jeopardy if all  of the functions in your area are either halted, stalled,  people laid off because of the actual moment in history that we  are in?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Are we at a serious moment in history that you need all  hands on deck?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Congresswoman, I think that is an accurate  statement."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I mean, we are--as this committee knows as well as  anyone, we are, as I said, under daily moment-by-moment efforts  by adversaries to penetrate our networks and systems across the  Federal Government, State, local, territorial, Tribal  government systems, and the private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"There is no pausing, no slowing down, in that range of  actors' efforts to penetrate our systems and to do us harm."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So  anything that hampers, we are running on a daily basis full  speed ahead to try to keep ahead of those--efforts of those  adversaries."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Anything that hampers and slows us down creates  risk for us and for the Nation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Jackson Lee.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If I could get these last two questions  in, I would greatly appreciate it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I started out by offering my assessment of the CTIC--CTIIC  and the NCCIC.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So if I could get the question answered as to  how the public is to decipher between these entities.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Then I  want to add a question of my colleague here on privacy.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Will the information shared that is going to be shared with  the Government identify the identity of law-abiding citizens?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Will it be the responsibility of the company--companies--for  removing personal information for what is shared with DHS?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So first, how are they gonna interface with these two  entities?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I am concerned about the confusion.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Then the privacy  question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Great.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I very much appreciate the question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We welcome the establishment of the Cyber Threat Intelligence  Integration Center.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Those two ``I''s are actually important to  help make this distinction.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Because what the CTIIC will do for  us is to pull together intelligence information from across the  16 different entities that make up that intelligence community  over which the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence, has  purview."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So that is a very useful function for us.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Part of their  articulated, explicit mission is to support the NCCIC, our  operations in watch center, and the other centers across  Government; the FBI's NCIJTF and the other centers out there  across Government."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"They are--in military terms, they are  supporting command and we are the supported demand."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So they  will provide that integrated analysis for us, which will be  very useful."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,They also will be one place where we can go to work with  the intelligence community to get information cleared for wide  dissemination.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So whether that is continuing to press  intelligence agencies to write or release, to create products  from the very beginning that can be widely disseminated or to  go back to them to get things declassified that we think are  important to disseminate widely."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Instead of having to go to 16  different entities, we can go to this one place who will be an  advocate for us, because that is their mission in making sure  we can disseminate this information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Those two key functions will be really helpful for us.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It  is a very distinct mission from our mission, which is to  interact with the private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That is not the mission of  the CTIIC.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Our mission is to interact on a daily basis with our  partners across the Federal Government and the private sector  and to receive information from them; and most importantly, to  get information out as broadly as we the can so that those who  are trying to defend their networks can do so effectively."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I will ask the deputy to address the privacy issue if----     Mr. Clawson [presiding].
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Quickly, if that is okay."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I will make it very quick, sir."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The privacy issue cuts to the core of why we do what we do  and why I came here to the Department to serve in Government.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The story I shared about the call from the FBI, this is one of  the finest investigators on the planet."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I wanted to answer him.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I couldn't.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If we had a system like this in place that night, I  could have."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,My lawyer would have given us the ability to share  just the indicators.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So what we are building----     Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That I understand.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So what we are building is with a team,  working every day with the FBI, their assistant director of  cyber."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,He called me last night just to make sure we were in the  loop on things.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This is the kind of relationship that we have.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,He called me on my cell phone a couple of weeks ago.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We have-- --     Ms. Jackson Lee.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Are you answering--I am sorry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I don't  want to interrupt.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But are you answering my question, which is  will the information----     Ms. Schneck."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Yes.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Jackson Lee [continuing].
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Shared identify--because I  want to--abide by the Chairman----     Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,No.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Working with----     Ms. Jackson Lee [continuing].
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Identify law-abiding citizens  and is the companies have the responsibility of removing the  personal data?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The companies have a responsibility to make a  good-faith effort.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This is a policy puzzle that which is being  solved each day by working together with each different equity  with the private sector, with law enforcement, with the  intelligence community."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We are doing our best to get everybody  to design that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Jackson Lee.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Mr. Chairman, I am just gonna say this for  the record and then yield back."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,You all issued $25 million in cybersecurity education  grants.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I noticed that States to the west of the Mississippi,  including Texas, have not been included."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I would like to meet  with whoever is appropriate to talk about these important  grants.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Because we need a vast array of representation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So  would someone let me know who I should be meeting with?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Absolutely, Congresswoman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That was  announced by the Department of Energy for historically black  colleges and universities.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We will absolutely make sure that  you get a full briefing on that and hear your thoughts.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Jackson Lee.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I thank the gentleman for his courtesy.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I yield back.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The Chairman recognizes the gentleman from  Texas, Mr. Hurd."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Hurd.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I would like to also thank y'all for being here.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This is an important topic.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I know a little something about it.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I spent 9 years as an undercover officer in the CIA.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,My job was  collecting intelligence on threats to the homeland.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But I also  did some offensive cyber operations and I recognize the  dangerous threat that is out there.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Helped start a  cybersecurity company, as well."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I have been doing that for the  last 5 years.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It is pretty scary, the folks that y'all have to  help defend against."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So it is a difficult job.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But I appreciate  you all being here.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"My question is, you know, when you look at Border Patrol  and ICE, they have difficulty sharing information amongst each  other."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,A lot of it is structural issues; right?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"You know, it  is--and then you talk about, you know, having DHS sharing with  FBI or CIA or NSA."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Even more difficult.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Then also trying to do  it with the private sector.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I know this is one of the areas  that these new entities have been created to do.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"My question is, you know, in an attack of the magnitude  that we are starting to see, one of the most important things  that you need is you need timely information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What is the  system--how are y'all trying to design this so that the  information is timely?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So as information comes in, it will go through  a process that is automatic."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So that is fractions of a second  for a machine.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Indicators will be available through those  standard protocols that every machine can read and every  machine can send.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So right now, we are depending our real-time  sharing on people to all be in the room to get it at once to  create a report and to fan it out."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Now you will have machines  do it at their speed, which is the speed of the adversary."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This already works in pockets in the private sector,  protecting against bot-nets."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"A few tens of thousands of  machines light up with bad behavior, and the rest of the world  can block against them."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We will do that for extended threats,  as well as the ability to combine what we see of protecting the  Government, combining it with what we see which may be  partnered or bought from private sector, and creating a large  set of data that can be provided to all."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Hurd.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So how do you plan on sharing tactics,  techniques, and procedures that the bad guys are using; right?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It is one thing to have an IP address or a piece of digital  code that you can share, that you can share quickly."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But some  of the--you know, they are looking at certain, you know, ports  or the style of the attack."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How is that gonna be shared with  the broader community?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think two ways.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"One is, that is currently  shared today across the agencies and with the private sector  through trusted relationships."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The other way is as we see those  indicators coming in, we build patterns that can be combined."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Again, this is where the CTIIC can help, as well."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That can be  combined with the intelligence they would give us and creating  an even broader picture for then people to disseminate that  context.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Hurd.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you for that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The other area is,  you know, the stuff that you are talking about, obviously, the  level of classification of the data, you know, is not going to  be a problem because you are sharing it, you know, with folks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But how do we address the classification of threat information  that is gathered by, you know, elements throughout the entire  Federal Government to push that down to the private sector?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So this is also an issue that we deal with  on a regular basis currently.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We have a couple of ways we  address this.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"One is, as I mentioned, the enhanced  cybersecurity services program that we are implementing and  have implemented, where we work with managed security providers  to build systems that can take Classified information and,  while protecting sources and methods, use that information to  provide enhanced cybersecurity solutions to their customers."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So this is a way for us to use Classified information, to  protect private-sector entities, without having to clear all of  those private-sector entities to receive the information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So  that is one way.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The other thing that we do is we do interact on a very  regular basis with the help of our intelligence and analysis  I&A; directorate, headed by General Frank Taylor, with the  intelligence community to help them understand what is the  information that we need to get out more broadly and what is  the information we don't need to share that might implicate  sources and methods."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That granularity we are able to achieve because we bring in  cleared private-sector folks who look at the intelligence and  say as a network defender, this is the piece I need."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I don't  need to know where it came from.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I don't need to know all of  these other things that are very sensitive.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But this bit I  need.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Then we can go back to the intelligence community and say  this is the piece we really need to get out to folks.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That equities review process is actually working fairly  well.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We have shortened the amount of time that it takes to run  through that process significantly.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We also have ways of,  again, working to mask sources and methods and be able to  disseminate that information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So these are issues we are working through, but would love  to sit down and talk with you."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,You might have some additional  insights and ideas for us to continue to push that boundary.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Hurd.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I yield back.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul [presiding].
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Mr. Hurd."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The Chairman now recognizes my fellow co-chair of the  cybersecurity caucus, Mr. Langevin."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Langevin.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I thank you, Mr.  Chairman, and Ranking Member Thompson for the attention and  support you have been giving to this topic for many years."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In  many ways, you and I were pioneers on this--in the Congress on  the challenges we face in cyber space."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I want to thank our panelists for their testimony today,  for the work you are doing on this issue."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I applaud your work  and the Department's work, and especially the President's  leadership on trying to better protect the Nation's cyber  space, close the glaring vulnerabilities that we face."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Of the range of things that we could do in this area and  clearly, we face significant challenges, I have often said that  this is never a problem, unfortunately, that we are going to  solve."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is a problem to be managed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Right now, the aperture  vulnerability is wide open."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What we need to do is shrink this  down to something that is much more manageable.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I have often said that the single most important thing we  can do in closing that aperture vulnerability is information  sharing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Right now in many ways we are fighting this battle  with both hands tied behind our back.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If we can inform, the  Government can share the information that it has with private  sector more easily and private sector can share the threat and  the hacks that they are experiencing, we can disseminate that,  we are going to be light years ahead of where we are right now."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So with that point--and maybe, Dr. Fischer, I will start  with you."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Information sharing is in many ways, it is a means to  an end."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is undoubtedly an important means.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, as has  been demonstrated, even at DHS, for example, during Heartbleed,  perfect information is useless without appropriate processes,  protocols, and people to act on it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So based on your scholarship, can you give a base  assessment of the proportion of cyber incidents that only  suceeded because information about a known threat was not  disseminated?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"How substantial an impact do you foresee cyber  information sharing legislation, such as the President's  proposal, having on the overall state of cybersecurity?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Fischer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, Congressman, I would have to get back to  you on the specifics with respect to what there might be--what  the proportion of attacks that have been, say, prevented  specifically with respect to--because of cybersecurity  information sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The question, though, with respect to--I mean, part of the  problem here is that there are--information sharing, as a  number of people have said, is no silver bullet."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is an  important tool for protecting systems and their contents.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As  long as organizations are not implementing even basic cyber  hygiene, there are going to be some significant difficulties."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So companies--there are demonstrated cases of companies  that have had the information which--but nevertheless, did not  pay sufficient attention to it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,They have had information they  could have used to prevent an attack.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If a company is not prepared to implement sort of threat  assessments that they receive, then that is going to be a  problem."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,A recent study by Hewlett Packard I think indicated  like 45 percent of companies do not actually have sufficient  basic cyber hygiene.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So those sorts of companies are not going  to be able to actually implement information sharing  effectively.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So--and what was the second part of your question,  sir?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Langevin.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I wanted to know the substantial impact that  you perceive that information-sharing legislation would have on  the--such as the President's bill would have on the overall  state of cybersecurity.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Fischer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That is something--there is a  fundamental sort of issue about the effectiveness of  information sharing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is very difficult to measure--and there  have been attempts by a number of folks.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I saw a recent study  by the Rand Corporation, for example, to try to analyze what  the effectiveness of information sharing is."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So you start out with a baseline.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So the question is well,  what is the current baseline for information sharing?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How much  would actually improving information sharing improve  cybersecurity?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"There are plenty of examples, specific examples."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is very--I think one could make a fairly compelling case on  principle as to why improving information sharing is important.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But to really be able to determine its actual effectiveness  will require, I think, additional information and study, and  perhaps some information that is not readily available now."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So  I am sorry I can't give you a--you know, a definite answer to  it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But it is an important challenge, and one I think that a  number of people are thinking about."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Langevin.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, my time is expired."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But I will have  additional questions for our witnesses.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I just want to thank  you for the expertise you bring to the table, the work you are  doing in this, and I look forward to supporting you in your  efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you for your strong  interest and leadership on this issue.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The Chairman now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr.  Carter."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Carter.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you to each of  you for being here.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This is obviously something that is very needed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I want to  speak about small businesses, in particular."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I am a small  business owner, or I was."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,My wife is now.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But, you know, I have  three independent retail pharmacies, have 19 employees."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,This is  important.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This is important to my business, just as it is  important to a big corporation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But it is tough.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It is tough  for us to adhere to some of the procedures, some of the  policies that we are gonna be forced to adhere to."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Do you take  that into account at all?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We absolutely pay, as the deputy said,  particular attention to small and medium-sized businesses."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So  the first thing that I want to point out is that even with this  information-sharing legislation, it is all voluntary."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So there  are no new requirements being imposed on businesses of any size  pursuant to this legislative proposal.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But that said, even a company that wants to voluntarily  participate in this may be challenged by a lack of resources  and the ability to bring on the human resources."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So we do look at how can we facilitate better cyber hygiene  by small and medium-size businesses.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Because they make up the  important part of that cyber ecosystem in which our critical  infrastructure swims.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We all swim in the same ocean.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As we saw  in the Target breach, those small companies can be an opening  for an adversary."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So I will let the deputy address a request for proposals  for information that we put out to the cybersecurity solution  providers to say, what ideas can you give us from your  innovation in the private sector to specifically address the  needs of small and medium-size businesses?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Because we  understand that is a real challenge, but it is critically  important."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Carter.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, and thank you for recognizing that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So as I mentioned earlier, it is the small  businesses and State and locals that also keep me at night."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Two  initial things I did when I came here.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,First is we put money to  protect the State and local governments and gave them  management security services that we paid for.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We couldn't do  that for small businesses.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So what we did was put out a request for information, which  is basically asking all the companies to please tell us how  would you use your innovation and use your desire for revenue,  use the market to drive better, faster, safer, cheaper  solutions that can enable, whether you are a small business  that makes the solution, makes money off it, or whether you are  one that gets the protection from it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The other piece I want to make very, very clear is in all  this technical talk, the main thing is that as we as a  Government are able to put together this indicator information,  that is available for you."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,You don't have to give us anything.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So you will inevitably, as any business, buy a few widgets to  protect yourself."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Whatever those widgets are in our vision--and  I don't mean in 5 years, I mean hopefully in 1, if not sooner-- will be able to start to talk to our big database and get what  we have."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We are not asking you to necessarily deliberately  share things.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So we are trying to just make it available to you  because we recognize that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Carter.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, good."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you for that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But let me ask  you, thus far have you had a good participation rate from small  and medium-sized businesses?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I have a binder literally that thick full of  responses to that proposal and requests for information that  could lead to a request for a proposal.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The team is looking at  how we act on that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It will go into a larger strategy in the  name of efficiency in cybersecurity really across DHS with all  the components, the two pieces of cyber."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But our State and local and Tribal territorial is--and our  small-to-medium business work--is huge to us.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This is homeland  security, not big business security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is everybody.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Carter.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, let me ask you this:  Specifically to health care, do you see any specific threats in  that?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I mean, you know, we have insurance information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We have  Social Security numbers, birth dates."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I mean, we have  everything that is essential that would use in a patient's  information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What are the real threats there?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So I think that any time you have a computer  that is connected to the internet, somebody can see whatever it  stores."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So the adversaries are looking for whatever the motive  that was mentioned earlier, they can get that information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So  what you have to do, no matter what the information, is find  the best way to secure those assets."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We will work with you on  that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We have people in each of the areas that can work with  you on that and partnerships with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  to get this message out.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We are absolutely seeing activity in the  health care arena.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Some of which appears to be for financial  gain.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It is a target-rich environment with very rich  information; beyond just Social Security numbers or credit card  numbers, for example; but information that can perpetrate other  criminal schemes, such as Medicare fraud."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So----     Mr. Carter.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Exactly.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Right?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So we are watching that very  carefully.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The FBI and others in law enforcement are looking at  this.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Carter.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, great."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you very much for what you  are doing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We appreciate this.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Mr. Speaker, I yield back."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Appreciate the promotion in my title.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But  I am not sure I would want to be Speaker right now, to be  honest."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The Chairman now recognizes Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you for  the generosity you demonstrated with the information sharing  that we have been doing here today.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"First of all, let me just acknowledge the fact that this  has been an incredible experience for me, information that you  have given me today."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I am really very, very proud that there  are two women at this helm."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I get to say that without possibly  being a discrimination complaint, being a woman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But it is  unusual, and it is an illustration that women should really be  in these areas much more."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,You all are fantastic.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So are you,  Mr. Fischer."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,You are fantastic too.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But even so, I have so many questions I just don't even  know where to begin."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"First of all, let me ask this."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"There is the--this CTIIC,  which is being proposed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"There is the NCCIC, which exists."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you so--oh, NCCIC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Sure enough is.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,CTIIC and NCCIC.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So what is the guarantee that the new proposal, this CTIIC,  doesn't wander out there and become the face of the interaction  with businesses and companies and stuff and basically infringes  upon the NCCIC?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Congresswoman, first of all, let me echo  your plug for encouragement for more women to get into STEM  fields."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think it is critically important.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So thank you for  that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"With regard to the CTIIC and the NCCIC, the CTIIC is very  clearly defined in the President's roll-out of this, which I  believe occurred this morning, just a couple of hours ago."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As a  place for integrating the intelligence information, it is  really to help Government."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is a Government-to-Government.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To  help the centers that exist already, including the NCCIC, to  have a common operating picture and all sorts of intelligence  analysis that we can provide to the private sector."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Again, we will also be taking in information from the  private sector and with appropriate safeguards for privacy and  civil liberty, sharing that with both the intelligence  community and law enforcement as appropriate to help enrich the  common picture that we all have."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So it--its responsibilities and its role are pretty clearly  defined, and I think very distinct from the role of the NCCIC  which, again, has been defined both by this committee and again  in the President's legislative proposal as the central place  for interacting with the private sector with regard to  indicator information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Should we not come up with the  funding, should there not be a funding solution on the 27th of  February?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Will the two of you be working on the 28th?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We will, Congresswoman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We will be working  without a paycheck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But we are under the statutory definition.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But I will tell you in my organization, the National Protection  Programs Directorate, which is responsible for critical  infrastructure security and resilience, we will be down to 57  percent of our workforce."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Are you at full force right now?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Right now we are at full force.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But of our a  little over 3,000 employees, if there is a funding hiatus, we  will be down to 1,748."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So it will be, again, 57 percent."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I want  to point out that those numbers include--most of those numbers  are the Federal Protective Service, which engages on a daily  basis in the critical mission of protecting Federal facilities,  and our office of biometrics and identity management, which  uses biometrics to particularly keep known and suspected  terrorists out of the country."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That is pretty scary.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Two critical important missions, they will  be on the job."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But the rest of my workforce that worries about  critical infrastructure in the private sector, cyber, will be  down to about 9 percent--normal strength----     Mrs. Watson Coleman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So I have two quick questions, because  that is pretty scary."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I need to know the difference between  ISAOs and ISACs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Yes.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,My other questions is to Mr. Fischer  real fast.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What is it that this new proposal that the White  House has put out, what does it address that is deficient in  what exists now?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Did we need to do this in an entirely new  legislative approach, or could there have been some tweaking to  what already existed?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So I should point out under the--in a  funding hiatus, our--again, we are gonna make sure that we have  in place everything we need to have in place to protect lives  and property on a daily basis."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So our NCCIC will continue to  function.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But the analytic support that feeds that and helps  prioritize those activities will be hampered, and the roll-out  of the things that I mentioned earlier will be hampered."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The ISAC, ISAO--ISACs information and analysis centers are  a kind of information sharing and analysis organization."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So  they are a subset, ISACs share a subset of ISAOs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What the  administration's Executive Order hopes to do is to encourage  additional coming together of private-sector entities to share  information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Fischer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Fischer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So what the--there are, I should preface by  saying that there are some observers who would argue that, in  fact, new legislation is not really necessary; that current  mechanisms are sufficient."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But there are plenty of people who  actually think the opposite, as well."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"With respect to what the new legislation would do, the  White House proposal, it would create some mechanisms,  including the establishment of these ISAOs for the receiving  and sharing of information that don't really exist now, or that  exists in another form; like, for example, the ISACs exist now  but they are--the ISAOs are somewhat different from that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It  specifically designates the NCCIC as a particular role with  respect to receiving and sharing this kind of information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It also would provide certain--it tries to remove these  barriers that have been mentioned that private-sector  organizations may have for sharing information and make sure  to--and provide protections for things like privacy and----     Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So you said, I believe, that there is  both the issue of barriers, and there is the issue of  incentives; incentives perhaps doing something, eliminating or  minimizing some of the barriers."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So is the incentive just  simply the value of the sharing of the information, or is there  some other kind of incentive that needs to use to encourage  these businesses to engage in this?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Fischer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So, I mean, one of the questions is  what would the--why would a company want to share information?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"One way, of course, to encourage them to share information is  to reduce the risks to them of sharing that information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But at  the same time, what are they going to get out of sharing it?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Are they doing it as simply a--something that they think is for  the public good, or are they gonna get something back?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So one of the ways that they might get something back is  through reciprocity.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So, for example, if they are a member of  an ISAC or perhaps an ISAO, they may have some relationship  with that organization that ensures that if they provide  information, they will be able to get information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But of course, with respect to the Federal Government,  there have been enough concerns about, you know, forcing  organizations to give information to the Federal Government  that, in fact, all of the legislative proposals say that they  are voluntary."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I yield back.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The Chairman now recognizes the Chairman  of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure  Protection, and Security Technologies, Mr. Ratcliffe."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Ratcliffe.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Ms. Spaulding, I would like to start with you."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The  administration's proposal discusses how Federal agencies--and I  will quote--``through an open and competitive process will  choose a private entity to identify and develop a common set of  best practices for the creation and operation of private  information sharing and analysis organizations.''
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The NIST, the National Institute of Standards and  Technology led a collaborative process last year to develop the  cybersecurity framework."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Why isn't this NIST framework, why  isn't it being utilized in the process here?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Congressman, I think it will be utilized in  the process here."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What the NIST framework does is provide a  framework, a way for companies to think about their  cybersecurity and how to achieve better cybersecurity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So it  breaks it down into five key functions; identify, identify the  assets you want to protect and the risks that it faces, ways to  protect, ways to detect, ways to respond, and ways to recover."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It pulled together from the private sector their best practices  in each of those categories.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So that is the cybersecurity  framework.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What this standards organization will do is to look at what  are the best practices for these ISAOs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Of the ISACs, of the  ISAOs, of the information-sharing organizations that are out  there today, which are the best ones, what are the best  practices that we see out there?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Let's pull that together as a  guideline for private-sector groups that want to come together  to say here are some of the best practices in terms of ways in  which they are protecting the information that has been given-- that is being shared in there.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So that I know that if I give it  to you, you are only going to share it within this ISAC, for  example."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Or ways in which you are going to protect privacy  information, et cetera; ways in which you are gonna get it out  quickly to me, get back to me, so that I get information for  information I give in."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How do I know I am going to get  something good back from it?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So it is a different set of best practices.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But the process  for developing that will be very similar to the one NIST used.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This third-party standards organization, will be canvassing the  private sector, the existing public and private-sector sharing  organizations to say to them tell us what you think are the  best practices."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Very collaborative is what we envision.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Ratcliffe.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Sure.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So I want to talk a little bit about  this--a single portal for information sharing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As a former  terrorism prosecutor after 9/11, while we would have liked the  information to come through one single avenue, what was more  important was that people would share information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So whether  it was with the FBI or whether it was with Secret Service, we  encouraged information sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So I am wondering if you can expound on the process here,  the thought process behind there just being one single portal  for sharing information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Yes, absolutely."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We totally agree.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The  highest priority is on information sharing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Again, that is such  a high priority, that even if it is only sharing between  private-sector companies and they don't share with the  Government, we think that is worth promoting, because sharing  of information is gonna significantly advance the ball here."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But with respect to sharing with the Government, again, we  want to make sure that existing relationships are not disrupted  here."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So companies that have relationships with the FBI, with  Treasury, with other parts of the Government and are  comfortable picking up the phone and calling them, they should  continue to reach out and say we think we see something, you  know, that looks a little strange on our system; we think we  may have some intrusion activity here."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That kind of information  sharing across Government we hope will continue to take place.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What we are trying to do--and even sharing of cyber threat  indicators can be shared--you know, we are not saying you can't  share it with other departments and agencies."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We are creating a newly-incentivized program.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If we are  doing that, we want to use that to help us create a common  operating picture."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So rather than have that information coming  in in a distributed, dispersed way all across the Government  and hope that it comes together somewhere at some point,  sometime, we want to say we would really like to incentivize  you to bring it in to this one place, and we will take  responsibility for making sure that it gets to the people who  need it very quickly."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But this way, we are--greater confidence, both that we have  a common operating picture and that privacy protections are  clearly in place."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Ratcliffe.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Terrific.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Ms. Spaulding."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Very quickly, Dr. Schneck, I wanted to give you an  opportunity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding and Dr. Fischer were able to expand  on Congresswoman Watson Coleman's question about privacy.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Just very quickly, I want to give you an opportunity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Can  you explain the processes in which NCCIC protects privacy and  explain that relationship with DHS privacy office?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Very quickly, DHS has one of the  first statutory privacy officers."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We work not only with the  front office at that level, but the under secretary has for our  directorate her own privacy officer that reports up."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Every  program that we have engages them.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,When I came in I actually  asked--because I write code.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Or I used to--the people that  write code, I asked them; are you getting rid of the extra  memory so that there isn't--because this is one of the famous  ways that attackers attack--so that there isn't a gap that we  didn't know about that is actually storing information that we  didn't know about."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Every step of the way in how we build our programs, we work  with those teams on privacy."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We also do impact assessments,  which means a document is published on our website."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What we do,  what we collect, what we are doing with it, and why we do it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As we grow these capabilities, that is an ingrained philosophy  in who we do at DHS."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"There has never been a harder time to want companies, as we  heard before and it is true, to share with Government."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,There  has also never been a more urgent time to put the indicators  together to respond to an adversary that candidly has an  infinite appropriation and does whatever they want.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We need to make sure that we have our defensive  capabilities as strong as they are.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That means putting this  data together.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is speed and privacy and the balance therein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It takes all hands on deck, everybody to work this."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Part of the  reason it is taking us more than just a few months to build  this capability is because we have to build it with the right  privacy, the right policy, and the right equities to make it  light speed and get it right."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Does that answer your question?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Ratcliffe.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It does.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I am out of time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But I  do want to thank you all of you for being here and for better  informing the committee Members so that we can hopefully move  forward with cyber legislation in this Congress.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I yield back.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank the gentleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Excuse me.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The Chairman now recognizes Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,and I also want to  join my colleagues in thanking the panel--or the witnesses for  being here.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Most of all, for spending an entire hour with some  of us, ensuring that we understand and that we somehow feel at  peace that you are collecting data that is absolutely  necessary, but actually being very cautious at ensuring that  individual privacy rights are being abided by."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We have also heard a lot from the perspective of corporate  America.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But what I haven't heard yet coming from you is how  you plan to communicate everything that you are doing with the  general public.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So someone like myself at home, where my  computer gets hacked and my IP address gets duplicated 15  times, how is my information as an individual victim or  survivor of a hack attack in my personal network, how are you  going to protect me from sharing my personal information with  anyone else?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I haven't heard it from a perspective that I think the  general public can relate to.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We have been speaking at this  level, and we haven't really simplified it in a way that my  constituents could be comfortable with what we are doing here."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So could you explain a little bit as to--in the private  session, you know, we heard specific information of what would  be pulled."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Can you speak to that here?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Congresswoman, thank you for the question."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As I hear it, it involves at least two aspects."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"One is as a  private citizen, what does this mean to me; right?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How is what  you have just been describing here for the last couple of hours  relevant to protecting my identity information----     Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Spaulding [continuing].
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For example, my PII?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"What I would say to that is that by protecting the networks  and systems that hold your information, we are protecting you-- and your--against identity theft, for example."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"One of the  pieces of legislation that the administration proposed--we have  talked about their information-sharing legislation, but they  also proposed breach notification legislation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That is very  much designed to protect consumers; to make sure that companies  have a single standard across the country for being required to  notify individuals when there is reasonable basis to believe  that their personal information may have been stolen, and to do  so promptly."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So that is very much geared toward the individual  and the consumer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,In terms of how do we reassure them that this work that we  are doing on their behalf is not interfering with their privacy  interests?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As we have talked today, we are very much focused on  the specific information that we need to defend networks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We  are very precise.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The legislation the administration has  proposed defines that information very carefully.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The automation that we are building will have a structured  way of providing that information that will minimize the  likelihood that information we don't need could be included.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We  place a very high priority on making sure that we are--we have  no interest, it does not help our network defense to gather a  lot of personal information about Americans or others."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I will let the deputy address that, as well."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Ms. Schneck.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I would only add that it is my hope that we  can use campaigns like our ``Stop.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Think.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Connect.''
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,messaging  or the awareness that we do every October in cybersecurity  awareness month.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think every month should be cyber awareness  month.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But we focus that month to get out on the road and talk  to everyone.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I am hoping that the public will start to understand this.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We have to work to take some of our technical terms and make  them actually English.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But start to understand that Government  is working very hard to protect them.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It starts with getting  our own agencies talking, which we are doing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It starts with  building into the private sector.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Then making sure that through  its providers of theirs of other programs with agencies in the  Federal Government that work directly with citizens, that we  get that right."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,But we need to really enhance the trust  relationship in the cyber area.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,So I am almost out of time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I just want to  make sure that I get my two other questions answered.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To this issue though, my final word on this is that we need  to ensure that that community outreach is part of whatever  legislation that we can produce; that community grants and  opportunities to include the public in this discussion happens."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Mr. Fischer, the fair information practice principles we  have been talking about, mentioned in the President's--in his  security Executive Order, how are they incorporated into the  Department procedures, from your perspective?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Fischer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, I think the Department people would  probably be better-situated to answer the specifics with  respect to that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But I think on the question of how privacy is  incorporated, it is a--one of the difficulties--and this also  gets back to your earlier question a little bit--that the  general public has various views of what privacy means."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,There  isn't any one really universal kind of understanding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"I mean,  there is something called, you know, ``personally identifiable  information,'' which is kind of interpreted as being something  that, you know, could actually identify a person specifically."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But when people think about privacy, they don't necessarily  think about it in the same way as Government may think about  privacy."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So, you know, if one is going to develop a set of  principles or use a set of principles or, in fact, incorporate  something like privacy by design, which has been around for a  long time, or something that people have tried to do, it is-- there--it can become very complicated very quickly."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think one of the things that is very important is to be  able to create a way of letting people understand specifically  what the issues are so that there can become really a consensus  among consumers about what it is that we are really trying to  protect.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Because one more point here, which is, you know, people are  always worried about--understandably, about Government and its  role."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But, in fact, people willingly give huge amounts of  information to private companies."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,We do.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mr. Fischer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If you get software that is free, it just  means you are the product."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Because the company is getting  something out of it.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Usually, that means they are getting  information from you; right?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, people don't even often realize this."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"You know, the  service agreements that we sign, I mean, who has time to read  through them or can understand them?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"So I think it is very  important that there be a--you know, a dialogue, really, about  how to characterize privacy more clearly for everybody so there  can be consensus."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think I am out of time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I yield  back.

"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Recognize the Ranking Member for closing  comments.

"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I just want to thank the  entire panel for giving us this time today and the information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Particularly, I want to thank you, Honorable, Honorable,  Honorable Spaulding and Dr. Schneck, because you have given us  the majority of the day when I knew you could be doing some  other things, including preparing for what might be a furlough  of some very important people."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I hope you don't have to do  that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"But I want you to know and I thank you, Chairman, for  guiding me through this very moment of being next to you."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Thank  you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Chairman McCaul.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Well, you did quite well, I must say."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Let me thank the witnesses.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Let me thank Ms. Spaulding and  Dr. Schneck for your service to our country on a very important  issue.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,I think the education process is very important for  Members of Congress and for the American people to identify  that this is a real and valid threat that we need to defend the  Nation from.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The hearing will be open for 10 days, the record I  should say."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,A P P E N D I X                                ----------                                    Questions From Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson for Suzanne E.                       Spaulding and Phyllis Schneck     Question 1.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"According to the testimony of the under secretary, the  White House legislative proposal on information sharing would immunize  against civil or criminal liability entities that voluntarily disclose  to or receive lawfully obtained cyber threat indicators from the NCCIC  or a private ISAO that has adopted certain best practices."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Please  explain the scope of the liability protection, including a delineation  of the circumstances in which liability protections would not be  afforded to an entity that chooses to disclose or receive information  from the NCCIC or a certified ISAO."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Answer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The President's information-sharing legislative proposal  provides targeted liability protection to private entities that  voluntarily disclose or receive lawfully obtained cyber threat  indicators from a private information security and analysis  organization (ISAO) or the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center (NCCIC).
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It affords such entities protection from  public disclosure, and from use of disclosed indicators as evidence in  a regulatory enforcement action."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The proposal directs DHS to select a non-governmental Standards  Organization for the purpose of identifying a common set of best  practices for the creation and operation of private ISAOs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The  Standards Organization will work directly with the public to identify  and develop best practices.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To receive the liability protection  afforded by the President's proposal, private-sector entities must  share with the NCCIC or an ISAO that has self-certified that it adheres  to these best practices."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Question 2a.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To receive liability protection, does a private entity  need any kind of certification from the NCCIC or an ISAO to which it  disclosed or from which it received cyber threat indicators?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If so, what standards would guide an NCCIC or ISAO in issuing such  a certification?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Answer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,There is no NCCIC- or ISAO-issued certification.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The  proposal directs DHS to select a non-governmental Standards  Organization for the purpose of identifying a common set of best  practices for the creation and operation of private ISAOs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The  Standards Organization will work directly with the private sector to  identify and develop best practices.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To receive the liability  protection afforded by the President's proposal, private-sector  entities must share with the NCCIC or an ISAO that has self-certified  that it adheres to these best practices."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The proposed independent standards organization for ISAOs would not  promulgate Government-determined standards or require a compliance  certification.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It would be an independent organization that sets forth  voluntary standards that it will develop in consultation with the  public.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Question 2b.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If no certification were required or issued, would a  court in the first instance have to assess whether a private entity  deserves immunity under Section 106?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Answer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,ISAOs would have to self-certify under Section 106 of the  information-sharing proposal.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,That self-certification is distinct from  any acknowledgement of receipt that the NCCIC or the ISAO might  generate as a way to reassure an entity sharing threat indicators that  it has submitted the information to the correct place.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Question 3.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What are the limitations of the ISAC model that  necessitate the effort to increase the proliferation of ISAOs?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Answer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,An ISAC is a type of ISAO.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In practice, as ISACs have  evolved, they are sector-specific entities that encourage information  sharing within specific critical infrastructure sectors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While ISACs  have had a great deal of success and lessons learned that will serve  ISAOs as they form, many companies do not fall within a designated  sector or fall within multiple sectors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,And some companies want to  share with partners outside of their sector for a wider scope of  situational awareness.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Encouraging ISAOs beyond just ISACS will provide for more  organizational flexibility.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"ISAOs can be organized around a particular  region, community of interest, or concern about a particular type of  cybersecurity risk."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,ISAOs could include companies regardless of their  sector affiliation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Question 4.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What are the risks and rewards of an information- sharing environment that is dominated by ISAOs?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Answer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Critical infrastructure includes both physical and cyber  infrastructure, publicly- and privately-owned."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The ISAO model builds  upon the successes of existing models.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The formulation of ISAOs allows  and encourages organizations to participate in cyber threat information  sharing to proactively detect and prevent cybersecurity incidents  before they can cause damage to their networks by applying the  knowledge, capabilities, and experiences of a wider community."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Sharing  cyber threat information broadly and with sufficient timeliness can  improve the Nation's cybersecurity writ large by reducing our cyber  adversaries' advantages of speed and stealth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Questions From Honorable Jim Langevin for Suzanne E. Spaulding and                              Phyllis Schneck     Question 1.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In reviewing the President's information-sharing  proposal, I was drawn to the phrase ``lawfully obtained'' as it relates  to cyber threat indicators."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Due to ambiguities in anti-hacking  statutes, courts have not yet settled whether the work of many well- intentioned security researchers--so-called white-hat hackers--is  lawfully obtained."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How can we work to ensure that information-sharing  legislation does not chill vital security research while at the same  time not opening the door to companies ``hacking back''?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Answer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The President's information-sharing proposal aims to  emphasize that activities conducted to obtain cyber indicators should  comply with the law.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The Department of Justice is best positioned to  answer questions pertaining to the relevant statutes and to what extent  they apply to the activities of cybersecurity researchers.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Question 2.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"It is vitally important that we incent private-to- private information sharing, something the President's proposal does  through the use of Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations  (ISAOs)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, ISAOs need only self-certify to be able to receive  threat indicators."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Without any independent oversight to be sure that  best practices are being followed, are you concerned that this could  lead to a reduction in privacy?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Answer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Having publically-available standards for ISAOs, including  standards for privacy protection, will help ISAO member companies hold  their ISAO accountable."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"ISAOs that are transparent and accountable are  likely to attract more members, providing an incentive to clearly  demonstrate compliance with the standards."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Question 3.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"We know that cyber threat information is most valuable  when shared expeditiously, which, in this domain, essentially means at  machine speed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How can DHS lead efforts to ensure that the stripping of  PII is accomplished as thoroughly and quickly as possible so that the  information shared is timely?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Answer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"DHS requests that, before sharing cyber threat information  with the Department, partners filter out any PII, content, and other  information that is not necessary to describing the cyber threat."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In  addition, currently, DHS Analysts are required to review cyber threat  indicator information for PII and handle it as outlined in US-CERT  standard operating procedures."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Generally, DHS's policy is to minimize  or redact any personal information that is not necessary to understand  or analyze a threat."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As we move to automated threat indicator sharing,  DHS and interagency partners are studying privacy-by-design technical  safeguards as well as policy and process approaches to minimization  that include a combination of automated removal and/or filtering of  sensitive data, oversight capabilities, and where necessary, manual  review."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Technical safeguard requirements may also be required.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To  safeguard Americans' personal privacy, the administration's  cybersecurity legislative proposal requires private entities to comply  with certain privacy restrictions, such as removing unnecessary  personal information and taking measures to protect any personal  information that must be shared, in order to qualify for liability  protection."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The proposal further requires the Attorney General, in  coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in  consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and  others, to develop receipt, retention, use, and disclosure guidelines  for the Federal Government."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Any future cybersecurity legislation will incorporate strong  privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties safeguards while  strengthening our critical infrastructure's security and resilience DHS  is committed to furthering information sharing and promoting  cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Question From Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson for Eric A. Fischer     Question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,What are the risks and rewards of an information-sharing  environment that is dominated by ISAOs?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Answer.\1\ This question cannot be answered definitively at  present.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Such an answer would depend on several factors that are  currently unknown or uncertain.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, the analysis below may be  useful in helping to determine the potential benefits and disadvantages  of the ISAO model in such an environment."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ Some responses were prepared in consultation with other CRS  experts.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     ISAOs (Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations) are defined  in the Homeland Security Act (6 U.S.C.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108," 131(5)) as ``any formal or  informal entity or collaboration created or employed by public or  private sector organizations'' created to assist in securing critical  infrastructure and protected systems by acquiring, analyzing, or  sharing ``critical infrastructure information,'' which refers to non- public information relating to threats to and defense and recovery of  critical infrastructure or protected systems."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) are more familiar  to most observers.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"They may also be considered ISAOs but have a  different origin, having been initially formed pursuant to a 1998  Presidential directive (PPD 63) on critical infrastructure  protection.\2\ The directive called for a single ISAC but also for a  National Infrastructure Protection Center (somewhat analogous to the  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center [NCCIC])  that would ``establish its own relations directly with others in the  private sector and with any information sharing and analysis entity  that the private sector may create."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"''\3\ Also, the directive stated  that the ``actual design and functions'' of the ISAC would ``be  determined by the private sector, in consultation with and with  assistance from the Federal Government.''"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The result was the creation  of several sector-focused ISACs, rather than a single entity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Many of  today's ISACs are associated with Federally-recognized critical  infrastructure sectors.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Eighteen are listed as members of the National  Council of ISACs (NCI).\4\ There are currently 16 Federally-recognized  critical infrastructure sectors.\5\ The table below shows the  relationships between those sectors and the ISACs.

CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Notes.--A Food and Agriculture ISAC and a Chemical ISAC were established   in 2002 (Government Accountability Office, Critical Infrastructure   Protection: Improving Information Sharing with Infrastructure Sectors,   July 2004, http://www.gao.gov/assets/250/243318.pdf) but appear to be   no longer operational."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The NCC, within DHS, has served as the   Communications ISAC since 2000 (http://www.dhs.gov/national-   coordinating-center-communications)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The ICS-ISAC is not listed as a   member of the NCI.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Other entities such as State governments may also   have ISACs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"As the table shows, ISACs currently exist for 12 of the designated  critical infrastructure sectors.\6\ There are also three ISACs that are  cross-sectoral."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,There appear to be few organizations that call  themselves ISAOs at present.\7\ The concept increased in prominence  following a legislative proposal and an Executive Order from the Obama  administration in January and February of 2015 fostering their  development and use.\8\ The White House described the intent as  ``expand[ing] information sharing by encouraging the formation of  communities that share information across a region or in response to a  specific emerging cyber threat.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"An ISAO could be a not-for-profit  community, a membership organization, or a single company facilitating  sharing among its customers or partners.''"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The Executive Order  specifies that ``ISAOs may be organized on the basis of sector, sub- sector, region, or any other affinity,'' that members may be public  sector, private sector, or both, and that an ISAO may be ``a not-for- profit community, a membership organization, or a single company  facilitating sharing among its customers or partners."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"''\9\ Under the  proposed legislation, ISAOs that wish to protect members from liability  risks for sharing information would need to be self-certified according  to standards to be developed under a process to be established by DHS."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \6\ Some caution should be exercised with respect to the  completeness of this list, as there may also be organizations that have  ISAC-like functions but do not call themselves ISACs."

"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"\9\ The Homeland Security Act definition is both broader, in that  ISAOs can be ``any formal or informal entity or collaboration created  or employed by public or private sector organizations'', and narrower,  in that under the act, the organizations must be ``created or  employed'' for ``gathering and analyzing,'' ``communicating or  disclosing,'' and ``voluntarily disseminating'' critical infrastructure  information as specified in the act (6 U.S.C."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,131(5)).
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The  administration proposal does not appear to limit ISAOs to information  about critical infrastructure, although its focus is on cybersecurity,  rather than on the all-hazards emphasis in the act."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     If this approach were adopted by Congress, ISAOs could possibly  become dominant entities in the information-sharing environment."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Given  the uncertainties associated with their anticipated impacts, it may be  best to examine possible effects through a series of questions:Would ISAOs lead to more information sharing among private-         sector entities and between the NCCIC and the private sector?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The broad and flexible nature of the ISAOs envisioned in the          administration proposal, as opposed to ISACs as currently          configured, could lead to the creation of ISAOs for affinity          groups for which ISACs are not viewed as applicable--for          example, the entertainment industry, with companies such as          Sony.\10\ That could lead to much broader information sharing          among private-sector entities that join the ISAOs and with the          NCCIC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Yet, there is no guarantee that new ISAOs would be          established, or, if they were, that they would lead to          increased information sharing either among the members or with          the NCCIC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Even for a few CI sectors, some former ISACs are no          longer in operation, and the degree to which existing ISACs are          active in information sharing is considered variable by many          observers."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Furthermore, the degree to which the NCCIC could          process and usefully disseminate the volume and variety of          information it may likely receive from a large number of ISAOs          is uncertain."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \10\ However, the IT-ISAC already lists Sony as a member (https:// www.it-isac.org/)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------Would increases in information sharing through ISAOs improve          cybersecurity?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The relationship between the volume of          information shared and improved cybersecurity is not          straightforward.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Both providers and recipients--whether they          are businesses, ISAOs, or Government agencies--will incur          various costs, including developing, assessing, processing,          sharing, and applying the information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For sharing to be          effective, information from the provider must be relevant to          recipients' needs and in forms that can be readily applied in          their IT and security environments."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Recipients must also have          the capacity and willingness to assess and use the information          received in a timely fashion.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"A large increase in the amount of          information received may in fact be counterproductive,          especially if much of the information proves to be of little          use to the recipient."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In theory, ISAOs can be closely tailored          to the needs of their members and therefore help ensure that          those needs are met."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, a closely-tailored ISAO might not          provide information relevant to all the lines of business in          which members may engage, and membership in several          organizations might be preferred.\11\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \11\ For example, Sony is involved in electronics, gaming, movies,  and music."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, it is not clear whether Sony would have been better  protected against recent attacks against it if it had been a member of  ISAOs in any of those subsectors in addition to its membership in the  IT-ISAC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------Would ISAOs provide overlapping or duplicative services?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,One          potential advantage of the sector-focused approach taken by the          ISACs is that it can minimize such duplication.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, it can          also create gaps for entities that do not fall clearly into one          or another ISAC sector or that are multi-sectoral."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Addressing          such gaps is one of the stated purposes of the administration's          ISAO proposal.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In addition, the potential for duplication          creates the potential for market competition, and such market          forces would ideally yield more innovation and more rapid          improvement in information sharing than would a more restricted          approach."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Market forces might also lead to lower costs, and          cost is often cited as an impediment to improved information          sharing, especially for small businesses."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Yet market forces          might also lead to higher costs, and a proliferation of ISAOs          might also make decisions about which one or ones to join more          difficult for potential members."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It also creates the          possibility that members could receive conflicting information          or even recommendations from different ISAOs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"At present, there          appear to be few examples of potentially overlapping          information-sharing entities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"One possible case is in the          health sector, which has both the Health ISAC \12\ and an ISAO,          the HITRUST Alliance.\13\ Services provided by the two appear          to be both complementary and potentially competitive.\14\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \12\ National Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, ``NH- ISAC,'' 2015."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------Would for-profit ISAOs be beneficial or disadvantageous for          improving information sharing?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The administration proposal          states that for-profit entities that share information can be          ISAOs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That would presumably include internet and cybersecurity          service providers, for example."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Such entities might be          particularly well-positioned to share information efficiently          and effectively with customers and to bring market forces to          bear favorably in the information-sharing environment.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However,          unintended adverse impacts are also possible."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For example, for-         profit companies might have a resource and marketing advantage          over non-profit organizations, and some may perceive such an          advantage as unfair or counterproductive."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It is also possible          that competitive pressures may impede information sharing          involving more than one company.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Some entities that could          potentially be ISAOs are currently members of ISACs and could          also be members of other ISAOs, creating possible conflicts of          interest.Would a cybersecurity environment dominated by ISAOs          complement or encumber improvement of cybersecurity risk          management?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The NIST Cybersecurity Framework,\15\ developed to          assist critical-infrastructure and other entities in adopting          effective cybersecurity risk management, discusses the role of          information sharing in cybersecurity, including the roles          played by ISACs and other entities in helping organizations          determine their desired levels--called tiers--of cybersecurity          implementation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Each of the four tiers includes descriptions of          risk-management processes and programs, and ``external          participation,'' which largely describes the level of          information sharing in which the organization engages.\16\          Broad availability of involvement with ISAOs could help          organizations that so desire to move to higher tiers with          respect to information sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, as the Framework makes          clear, that is only one facet of cybersecurity implementation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"There may be a risk, therefore, that a proliferation of ISAOs          would lead to an overemphasis on information sharing to the          detriment of other, possibly more critical cybersecurity needs,          thereby resulting paradoxically in a decline in overall          cybersecurity preparedness."

"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------Would the proposed ISAO standards process sufficiently          address concerns such as those raised above?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Both the          legislative proposal and the Executive Order call for          designation of a nongovernmental organization whose purpose          would be to specify a ``common set'' of ``best practices'' or          ``voluntary standards or guidelines'' for creating and          operating ISAOs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Such standards and practices may help address          some but not all of the issues discussed above.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For example,          standards may be helpful in determining what kinds of          information may be most useful to share for different purposes          and different kinds of entities, as well as how best to use          such information, but it seems unlikely that they can address          concerns about overlapping or duplicative services, or problems          such as gaps in coverage for key groups caused by economic          factors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If ISAOs do in fact proliferate, it is very likely that substantial  changes will occur in the information-sharing environment, but many of  those effects may be difficult or even impossible to predict  accurately."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"However, there appear to be few independent assessments of  the performance and effectiveness of current information-sharing  entities and their relationships.\17\ Some studies have concluded that  measuring the effectiveness of information sharing is difficult in the  current environment,\18\ and the creation of a large number of ISAOs  could further complicate any assessments."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Such concerns might be  addressed by options such as on-going independent research and  evaluation activities designed to determine the effectiveness of ISAOs,  perhaps as a part of or complementary to the standards-development and  revision process envisioned by the administration."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That could  potentially be started in conjunction with another option-staged  implementation of the ISAO model, perhaps including pilot programs.\19\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \17\ One example is Government Accountability Office, Public  Transit Security Information Sharing: DHS Could Improve Information  Sharing Through Streamlining and Increased Outreach, September 2010,  http://www.gao.gov/assets/310/309903.pdf."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In reviewing the President's information-sharing  proposal, I was drawn to the phrase ``lawfully obtained'' as it relates  to cyber threat indicators."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Due to ambiguities in anti-hacking  statutes, courts have not yet settled whether the work of many well- intentioned security researchers--so-called white-hat hackers--is  lawfully obtained."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,How can we work to ensure that information-sharing  legislation does not chill vital security research while at the same  time not opening the door to companies ``hacking back''?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Answer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The current cybersecurity environment creates a number of  dilemmas, and one of them is captured by this question."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"The problem is  that the complexities of cyberspace--whether hardware, software,  networks, or the people using them--combined with its rapid  technological evolution and the changing threat environment, create  significant challenges for distinguishing appropriate and inappropriate  behavior, especially by those pursuing protective and defensive  activities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Such ambiguity can create problems for legal and ethical  interpretation of such actions and is believed by at least some  observers to have a potentially chilling effect on needed research.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"This is not a new issue,\20\ but some legislative proposals to improve  cybersecurity have led to increased attention to the concern.\21\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \20\ Aaron J.

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     In addition, researchers who are part of an established and  recognized enterprise, such as a university or research institution,  are likely to have different opportunities and constraints than those  who operate independently, without either the benefits or the  strictures of an institutional environment."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Also, research may refer to  many different activities, from the acquisition of fundamental  knowledge about threats, vulnerabilities, and defenses, to the  development of hardware, software, and procedures to address  cybersecurity needs, to the investigation of specific incidents for  purposes of attribution and response."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Constraints on research are  likely to apply to such different classes of researchers and activities  in significantly different ways.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,One of the core challenges in finding ways to reduce the risk that  the legal environment will chill needed research is in reaching a clear  consensus among stakeholders about what constitutes proper and improper  research activity.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If such a consensus can be reached, legal  ambiguities might be much more easily resolved."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Without a consensus,  resolution is likely to be very difficult."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For example, some may argue  that a research exception should be provided in communications privacy  laws,\22\ but without agreement on what is and is not appropriate  behavior, such an exception may be difficult to scope."

"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Another issue that may be worth considering is lack of  understanding and education among researchers about what they can and  cannot do under current law and regulations.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Researchers may be  reluctant to take some actions that are lawful solely because of  uncertainty about their legality.\23\ One way to address this issue is  to provide researchers with access to appropriate education resources  that can clarify what is permitted and also provide guidance for  reducing the risk of violating legal requirements.\24\ For example, the  legal risks associated with the use of honeypots--websites or other  information resources specifically designed to attract attacks--may  depend, some have argued, on how they are implemented.\25\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \23\ Ibid."

CHRG-114hhrg94108,"That will require staff  time and perhaps additional hardware and software, especially for  implementation of so-called ``real-time'' information sharing, which  often involves machine-to-machine communication and action."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Such costs  may be particularly problematic for small businesses, which may be of  concern not only because of their broad role in the economy, but also  because the sector includes many innovators that can be inviting  targets for cyber espionage, and because many are contractors with  larger organizations that may be inviting targets for cyber crime.\28\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \27\ See, for example, N.

CHRG-114hhrg94108,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Awareness     Concerns about the lack of awareness about cybersecurity in general  and information sharing in particular, especially within the private  sector, have been long-standing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While the NIST Cybersecurity Framework  \29\ and other efforts, along with media attention to major breaches,  appear to have resulted in some increased awareness of the need for  better cybersecurity, it is not yet clear the degree to which awareness  has improved as a result."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Awareness of a problem or need is also not  sufficient on its own.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"To be effective, it must be translated into  appropriate action, which often may not be the case."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For example,  according to a 2012 survey, three-quarters of small businesses believe  that cybersecurity is important, but only 10% have a written policy on  it.\30\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \29\ National Institute of Standards and Technology,  ``Cybersecurity Framework,'' August 26, 2014, http://www.nist.gov/ cyberframework/index.cfm."

"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Usefulness of Information     Many kinds of information can be shared, from threat intelligence  \31\ to business strategies and best practices."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In addition, the same  information may have different utility for different users--for  example, threat signatures relating to attacks on one critical  infrastructure sector may be of marginal concern for another, and best  practices may be much more useful for small businesses than signatures  associated with advanced targeted threats."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Also, shared information may  prove of little use if it is delayed, provided without relevant  contextual detail, or provided in a form that requires substantial  additional processing to determine its applicability."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If recipients  find that the information they are provided is of little use to them,  they may be less likely to participate in or continue with information- sharing initiatives."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \31\ This can be described as ``indicators (i.e., an artifact or  observable that suggests that an attack is imminent, that an attack is  underway, or that a compromise may have already occurred); the TTPs  [tactics, techniques and procedures] of an adversary; and recommended  actions to counter an attack'' Chris Johnson, Lee Badger, and David  Waltermire, Guide to Cyber Threat Information Sharing (Draft), SP 800- 150 [National Institute of Standards and Technology, October 2014], 4,  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-15sp800_150_draft.pdf."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Application of Information     Information sharing by itself is not sufficient to improve  cybersecurity.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Not only must it be actionable--presented in a form that  can be usefully applied--but the recipient must also have processes,  including equipment and software, in place to use the information  effectively."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If such processes are not in place and utilized properly,  the net effect is the same as if the information were not shared at  all.\32\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \32\ See, for example, Johnson, Badger, and Waltermire, Guide to  Cyber Threat Information Sharing (Draft)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reliability of Sources     There are several reasons why sources of information may not be  considered reliable by potential recipients.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For example, the source  may be a competitor, such as another business."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,The kinds of information  the source provides may focus on a set of entities other than the one  to which the recipient belongs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Or the source might have a reputation  for providing erroneous, outdated, or otherwise useless information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"If  no sources are available to an entity that it deems reliable, it may be  reluctant to participate in information-sharing activities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Mechanisms for Information Sharing     Currently, there appear to be two general models for information  sharing--a decentralized, ``peer-to-peer,'' often informal approach  between entities with complementary needs, and a more centralized  ``hub-and-spoke'' model such as the ISACs.\33\ Organizations such as  ISACs are generally sector-specific."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Not all sectors have such  organizations, and other affiliations other than sector may also be  important for some kinds of information sharing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Filling such gaps  appears to be part of the rationale behind the administration's ISAO  proposal.\34\ On the one hand, the absence of an appropriate mechanism  can be a barrier to information sharing for an entity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"On the other  hand, a proliferation of mechanisms, such as some observers fear the  administration's ISAO model might result in, could also serve as a  barrier if it makes information sharing inefficient or confusing for  possible participants."

CHRG-114hhrg94108,--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Standards     The adoption of standards for information sharing is one way to  help address concerns about reliability and utility of information  received.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,Dozens of standards exist relating to information  sharing.\35\ The Department of Homeland Security has been developing a  single set applicable to sharing of threat intelligence.\36\ Lack of a  broadly-accepted set of consensus standards or a framework for  information sharing might impede more wide-spread adoption of  information-sharing activities.

CHRG-114hhrg94108,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Economic Incentives     Some observers have noted that the benefits of receiving  cybersecurity information tend to outweigh the benefits of providing  such information for many organizations.\37\ In addition to legal  issues that may be associated with providing information, businesses  may be concerned about reputation costs, if they provide information  showing that they have been victims of cyber attacks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"In the absence of  incentives for reciprocity, it is hard to see what benefit an  organization would gain from providing information, unless it is a  Government entity whose mission is to provide such data or a provider  of cybersecurity services."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"Government measures such as requirements for  data-breach notification, as enacted in most States, can provide  incentives for organizations to share information about attacks that  may be used to help prevent future attacks on other entities or to  capture and prosecute cyber criminals."

"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reducing the Need for Information Sharing     Some observers have expressed concern about risks associated with  an overemphasis on the role of information sharing in cybersecurity.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,It  is only one of many cybersecurity tools.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"For example, it is a  relatively small part of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and target  levels of sharing vary among the tiers the Framework identified.\38\ In  addition, information sharing tends to focus on immediate concerns such  as cyber attacks and imminent threats."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94108,"While those must be addressed,  that does not diminish the need to reduce risks through design and  implementation of more secure systems and networks--sometimes referred  to as ``building security in''--and finding ways to change the  incentive structure within cyber space to increase the costs and reduce  the potential for profit from cyber crime and activities of other  adversaries."
