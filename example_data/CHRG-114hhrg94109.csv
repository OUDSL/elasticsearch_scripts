CHRG-114hhrg94109,"----------                                                       Thursday, February 26, 2015               U.S. House of Representatives,                      Subcommittee on Oversight and                               Management Efficiency,                             Committee on Homeland Security,                                                     Washington, DC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:03 a.m., in  Room 311, Cannon House Office Building, Hon."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Scott Perry  [Chairman of the subcommittee] presiding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Present: Representatives Perry, Clawson, Loudermilk, Watson  Coleman, Richmond, and Torres."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Good morning.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Committee on Homeland Security  Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency will come  to order.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The purpose of this hearing is to receive testimony  regarding the recommendations from the Government  Accountability Office and DHS inspector general to improve the  Department of Homeland Security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Before I begin, I would like to welcome the new Members of  the subcommittee."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Unfortunately, I am sure there is a lot going  on this morning."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I literally have three places to be at one  time, and I think most of us are the same way."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Just the same,  to officially welcome them to the subcommittee."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The other  Members bring with them tremendous private-sector, military,  and other experience which will be helpful in our oversight of  the Department of Homeland Security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I also look forward to  working with all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Ranking Member Watson Coleman and I met recently to discuss  the subcommittee's priorities, and I look forward to working  with her on areas of mutual interest."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I now recognize myself for an opening statement.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Last month the Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson,  in a speech before the Wilson Center, said that regarding how  his Department conducts business and protects the homeland, we  are still finding our way, but we are headed in the right  direction."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"While I certainly give Secretary Johnson credit for  trying to improve relations with Congress, his statement and  acknowledgement of mediocrity is very disappointing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Secretary also made discouraging statements about  recent border security legislation passed by this committee as  unworkable and impossible to achieve.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As the Oversight and  Management Efficiency Subcommittee, we must hold the Department  accountable to the highest standards given that our National  debt is over $18 trillion and we face numerous threats."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Whether  from radical jihadi terrorists intent on attacking us, to  porous borders with a steady flow through the illegal  immigrants and drugs coming into our communities, DHS simply  must secure the homeland efficiently and effectively."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Folks back home in Pennsylvania didn't send me to  Washington to watch their tax dollars wasted on ineffective  programs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Testimony from our witnesses today is, then, so important."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Watchdogs from the Government Accountability Office, the GAO,  and DHS Office of Inspector General, the OIG, safeguard  taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Earlier this month, GAO released its high-risk list of  areas in the Federal Government most susceptible to  mismanagement."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Despite DHS's hope that it will get off the list  soon, areas related to DHS management functions, terrorism- related information sharing, and cybersecurity continue to  remain at high risk to fraud, waste, and abuse according to  GAO's 2015 report."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In addition, OIG releases an annual report on major  management challenges facing DHS."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The 2014 report identified  nine broad areas where the Department faces serious management  and performance challenges.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,OIG also identified hundreds of  millions of dollars in questionable costs and funds that could  be put to better use.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Hundreds of recommendations by these  watchdogs remain open and unimplemented by DHS at this time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"A recent GAO and OIG report also highlighted specific  dysfunctional programs where management failures continue at  DHS, to include the following: Ineffective use of unmanned  aerial systems at the border; a lack of a cybersecurity  strategy for Federal facility, physical facility, and access  control systems; failure to adequately manage DHS's  headquarters consolidation project at St. Elizabeths;  mismanagement in processing Freedom of Information Act or FOIA  requests; and a lack of rigorous covert testing program for  nuclear smuggling at our borders."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"These reports show serious  deficiencies in how DHS secures the border, protects Federal  buildings from cyber attacks, and manages billions of taxpayer  dollars."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS must act on these and other recommendations to  improve our homeland security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Finally, I need to hear more from the inspector general on  a recent report where in his opinion TSA attempted to cover up  embarrassing findings using its authority to classify  information as Sensitive."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I am concerned that TSA failed to  provide a timely explanation to the IG's report's findings  regarding Sensitive security markings.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Although DHS has a  responsibility to protect information that if released could  harm our National security, DHS has absolutely no excuse to  hide information from the American people simply to avoid  embarrassment."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Secretary Johnson said that management reform  itself is a homeland security imperative.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, DHS has a  long way to go to reach its full potential."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses on their  recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of  DHS and what the Department is doing to address these concerns.
"

"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Chairman now recognizes the Ranking Minority  Member of the subcommittee, the gentlelady from New Jersey,  Mrs. Watson Coleman, for a statement she may have."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and  thank you for holding this important hearing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I look forward to  working with you during the 114th Congress to ensure that the  Department of Homeland Security has the direction and resources  it needs to perform its critical mission as efficiently and  effectively as possible.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I also extend my gratitude to our distinguished panel of  witnesses that are appearing before the subcommittee this  morning.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,During the hearing I will be especially interested to  hear the witnesses' perspectives on the impact of a lapse in  funding for the Department of Homeland Security; what it would  have on the DHS's ability to implement the recommendations that  we will be discussing today.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Given that the Department endured the challenges of a lapse  in funding less than 2 years ago and the dangers another  shutdown of DHS would pose to our Nation's security, I  sincerely hope that my Republican colleagues will realize the  error of their ways and pass a full funding measure for the  Department without strings attached."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The women and men who so  ably work for the Department deserve guarantees that they will  continue to be compensated for their service on behalf of our  Nation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"To that end, I am eager to hear from Inspector General Roth  regarding what happens to his audit staff that produce the  recommendations that result in the savings for the taxpayer in  the event of a lapse in funding in the Department."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Regarding recommendations in DHS's progress, I also look  forward to hearing from Inspector General Roth regarding how  the number of open unresolved recommendations decreased from  691 to 94 between 2011 and 2014, and how the improvement  corresponds to the Department's proactive interactions with the  Office of Inspector General."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I look forward to hearing from Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Gambler regarding GAO's  assessment of the Department's improvement in the areas of  greater commitment by its leadership, senior leadership, and  the implementation of a corrective action plan to address these  long-standing management issues."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I, as I know my colleagues on the committee are, I am  committed to seeing that DHS's management functions are removed  from GAO's high-risk list."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler and her team have  provided the road map for DHS to be removed from the high-risk  list.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is now up to the Department to implement the reforms  and policies we know are needed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is also up to Congress to  provide the Department the funds and support necessary to stay  on track.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Given Dr. Gerstein's recent opinion piece in Politico, I am  eager to hear him share his views on how the Department can  build on the success of its response to Superstorm Sandy in  2012."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I am also interested in hearing Dr. Gerstein's  perspective on the Secretary's Unity of Effort initiative and  what he believes Congress can do to aid the Department in its  mission.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank you again for holding this  hearing today and for not letting a little bit of snow delay  our work."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"With that, I yield back the balance of my time."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"[The statement of Ranking Member Watson Coleman follows:]            Statement of Ranking Member Bonnie Watson Coleman                            February 26, 2015     Thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this important hearing today."
"
"

"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Other Members of the subcommittee are reminded  that opening statements may be submitted for the record.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"[The statement of Ranking Member Thompson follows:]              Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson                            February 26, 2015     Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,And thank you for holding the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Management Efficiency's first hearing of the 114th Congress.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I look forward to seeing this subcommittee, with you and Ranking  Member Watson Coleman at the helm, conduct vigilant and bipartisan  oversight of the Department of Homeland Security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would also like to thank the panel of witnesses for appearing  today.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I look forward to hearing from each of you about your  recommendations for how the Department of Homeland Security can become  more efficient and effective in its mission of securing the homeland.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Unfortunately, as we meet today to discuss recommendations for DHS,  Republicans in the House continue to put partisan politics and  pandering to their fringe ahead of funding the Department responsible  for keeping the homeland secure."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,They are doing so at a time of increased security concerns both at  home and abroad.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This week, rather than focusing on implementing recommendations  issued by GAO and the Inspector General, among their other important  duties, DHS employees are being forced to prepare for furloughs and the  stress that accompanies working without knowing when your next paycheck  may come."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"With that in mind, I have a recommendation for my Republican  colleagues regarding homeland security--fully fund the Department  without strings attached so that DHS and its dedicated employees can  focus on their mission."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Regrettably, damage has already been done by the Republican  brinksmanship regarding funding for DHS."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As Dr. Gerstein points out in his written testimony, even just the  specter of a lapse in funding for the Department of Homeland Security  has costs and is a signification distraction."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"While I remain hopeful that my Republican colleagues will recognize  the error of their ways on this issue, any confidence I had in their  ability to govern responsibly has been further eroded."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Turning to recommendations for DHS, I look forward to hearing from  Inspector General Roth regarding his new initiative for verification  reviews to ensure recommendations are fully implemented by the  Department and that the actions taken had the intended effect."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"While we are pleased when DHS concurs with a recommendation, the  real benefit is found in the implementation, not the mere  acknowledgement that there is a problem."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I am also eager to hear from the Inspector General regarding his  concerns with the Transportation Security Administration's use, and  what he believes to be misuse, of the Sensitive Security Information  designation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Regarding TSA, I have questions for Ms."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler of GAO about the  agency's expedited passenger screening program and continued use of  behavior detection as a method for screening passengers.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Given Dr. Gerstein's time in senior positions within DHS, I look  forward to hearing his insider's perspective on how he believes the  Department can become more effective and efficient."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Before yielding back, I would like to acknowledge the good work of  Stephen Caldwell who recently retired after more than 30 years of  service with GAO."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,His work on security issues was invaluable to both this committee  and the Department of Homeland Security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"With that Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We are pleased to have a distinguished panel of  witnesses before us today, and this important topic."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Let me remind the witnesses that their entire written  statement will appear in the record, and that I will introduce  each of you first and then recognize you individually for your  testimony."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Honorable John Roth assumed the post of inspector  general for the Department of Homeland Security in March 2014.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Previously, Mr. Roth served as the director of the Office of  Criminal Investigations at the Food and Drug Administration,  and as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of  Michigan."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Ms. Rebecca Gambler is a director of homeland security and  justice issues with the Government Accountability Office, the  GAO."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Gambler leads GAO's work related to border security  and immigration, as well as DHS's management issues."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Dr. Daniel Gerstein is a senior policy researcher with the  RAND Corporation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Prior to joining RAND, Dr. Gerstein was the  acting under secretary and deputy under secretary for DHS's  Science and Technology Directorate, where he managed efforts  related to cybersecurity, biodefense, and other issues."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Dr.  Gerstein also served in several positions in the Defense  Department.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you all for being here today.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Chairman now recognizes Mr. Roth for your testimony.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"STATEMENT OF JOHN ROTH, INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF                         HOMELAND SECURITY      Mr. Roth."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Watson Coleman, and Members  of the subcommittee, thank you for the invitation here to  discuss our recommendations to improve Homeland Security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I have submitted a more detailed written statement for the  record, but for my oral statement I would like to focus on the  Department's continued challenges in the area of acquisition  and program management."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Acquisition and program management at DHS is inherently  complex and high-risk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is further challenged by the  magnitude and diversity of the Department's procurements.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS  acquires more than $25 billion worth of goods and services  every year.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Although DHS has improved its acquisition process,  many major acquisition programs lack the management controls  necessary to manage risk and measure performance."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Components do  not always follow Department acquisition guidance, which leads  to cost overruns, missed schedules, and mediocre acquisition  performance."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"All of these have an effect on budget, security,  and the efficient use of resources."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I will give three examples today.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"First, we conducted an  audit on the acquisition of housing units in Ajo, Arizona, in  which DHS spent about $680,000 for each of the houses that they  built."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This is in an area where the average home price was  about $86,000."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We identified about $4.6 million that CBP spent  on the project that could have been put to better use.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"A second example, in a recent management advisory we  brought to the Department's attention an issue related to CBP's  National aviation maintenance contract."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In 2009, CBP awarded a  $938 million contract to an outside vendor to maintain about  265 aircraft which were to fly approximately 100,000 hours per  year."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"During the course of the contract, the number of CBP  aircraft maintained, the annual flight hours, and the average  age of the aircraft fleet all decreased."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As a result, we would  have expected that the maintenance costs would decrease as  well."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In fact, the contract costs actually increased at a rate  of about 9 percent per year."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We did an audit, and we attempted to compare the labor-hour  data being used by the contractor to that being kept by CBP, in  an attempt to understand whether we were being charged for work  that was actually performed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Unfortunately, because of  inconsistent and unreliable data kept by both CBP and the  contractor, we were unable to do so."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,This means we don't know  whether we received what we paid for.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is a pretty  fundamental thing to understand in a billion-dollar maintenance  contract.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Third, as a third example, we recently reported that  although CBP's unmanned drone program contributes to border  security, after 8 years CBP cannot prove that the program is  effective because it has not developed performance measures."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The program has also not achieved the results they had  established when they started the program.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The aircraft are not  meeting flight-hour goals, and we found little or no evidence  that CBP met its program expectations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"CBP anticipated using the unmanned aircraft to patrol more  than 23,000 hours per year, but in fact the aircraft logged  only a combined total of about 5,100 hours per year, about 80  percent less than what was anticipated."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As a result, CBP has  invested significant funds, about $360 million over the course  of 8 years, in a program that has not achieved the expected  results and it cannot demonstrate how much the program has  improved border security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The $443 million CBP plans to spend on program expansion  could be put to better use by investing in alternatives such as  manned aircraft and ground surveillance assets.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As we conduct our work for fiscal 2015, we began with two  priorities, to aid the Department in achieving its critical  missions and priorities, and to ensure that they engaged in  proper stewardship and integrity of taxpayer dollars."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We also conduct, of course, legislatively mandated work and  make an earnest effort to address the concerns of Congress and  the Department along with our other stakeholders."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We attempt to  be transparent in our work.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Our annual performance plan and our  current list of on-going projects are published on our website  to better inform the Congress and the public regarding our  work.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Mr. Chairman, this concludes my remarks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I welcome any  questions you or any other Members of the committee have.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"[The prepared statement of Mr. Roth follows:]                     Prepared Statement of John Roth                            February 26, 2015     Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Watson Coleman, and Members of the  subcommittee: Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss our  recommendations to improve homeland security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I am pleased to have the  opportunity to share our efforts to improve DHS through our independent  audits and inspections, as well as our efforts to ensure the integrity  of the DHS workforce and its operations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I would like to focus on some of DHS' challenges, many of which we  highlighted in our fiscal year 2014 report on major management  challenges, and some of which at times hamper our efforts to improve  the Department's programs and operations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"My testimony today will focus  on recent and upcoming audits in four areas: Unity of Effort,  acquisition management, IT management, and financial management."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"recent and upcoming work Unity of Effort     Given its history as a group of very diverse agencies and its  complex, multi-faceted mission, it is not surprising that the  Department continues to face challenges transforming itself into a  cohesive single agency."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"To accomplish its mission, DHS must have a  strong, yet flexible, central authority that is able to ensure the  components collaborate for maximum effectiveness and cost efficiency."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"A  unified culture within DHS is necessary for better homeland security,  as well as deriving efficiencies from the integration of operations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Secretary's April 2014 Unity of Effort initiative is a positive  step towards achieving that change.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In addition, DHS must strengthen  its efforts to integrate management operations under an authoritative  governing structure capable of effectively overseeing and managing  programs that cross component lines."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We have observed that the components often have similar  responsibilities and challenges, but many times operate independently  and do not unify their efforts, cooperate, or share information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,This  situation is sometimes exacerbated by components' disregard for DHS'  policies.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Together, these problems hamper operations and lead to  wasteful spending; for instance,Last year, we found that DHS did not adequately manage or          have the enforcement authority over its components' vehicle          fleet operations to ensure right-sizing, that is, to make          certain the motor vehicle fleet includes the correct number and          type of vehicles."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Without a centralized fleet management          information system, the Department has to rely on multiple          systems that contain inaccurate and incomplete vehicle data."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Additionally, each component manages its own vehicle fleet,          making it difficult for the DHS Fleet Manager to provide          adequate oversight and ensure the components comply with          Federal laws, regulations, policies, and directives."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We found          that the components were operating underused vehicles, which in          fiscal year 2012, cost DHS from $35 to $49 million."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"(DHS Does          Not Adequately Mange or Have Enforcement Authority Over its          Component's Vehicle Fleet Operations, OIG 14-126)The Department's failure to adequately plan and manage          programs and ensure compliance was also evident in our audit of          DHS' preparedness for a pandemic."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We found that the Department          did not develop and implement stockpile replenishment plans,          sufficient inventory controls to monitor stockpiles, or have          adequate contract oversight processes; DHS also did not ensure          compliance with its guidelines."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thus, DHS was not effectively          managing its stockpile of pandemic equipment and antiviral          medications, and components were maintaining inaccurate          inventories of pandemic preparedness supplies."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Consequently,          the Department cannot be certain it has sufficient equipment          and medical countermeasures to respond to a pandemic."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"(DHS Has          Not Effectively Managed Pandemic Personal Protective Equipment          and Antiviral Medical Countermeasures, OIG 14-129)     In fiscal year 2015, we will continue to monitor the Department's  efforts toward achieving Unity of Effort; for example,DHS operates a number of training centers to meet the demand          for specialized skills across the Department."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We have just          begun an audit to determine whether DHS' oversight of its          training centers ensures the most cost-effective use of          resources.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Although the Department has made great strides in          improving both the quality and availability of training, we          believe there may be opportunities to reduce overall cost by          identifying redundant capacity.Another forthcoming audit focuses on whether DHS has the          information it needs to effectively manage its warehouses."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Until recently, the components managed their own warehouse          needs with little or no joint effort."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We expect to publish the          final report by June 2015.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Acquisition Management     Acquisition management at DHS is inherently complex and high-risk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is further challenged by the magnitude and diversity of the  Department's procurements.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS acquires more than $25 billion \1\ worth  of goods and services each year.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Although DHS has improved its  acquisition processes, many major acquisition programs lack the  foundational documents and management controls necessary to manage  risks and measure performance."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Components do not always follow  Departmental acquisition guidance, which leads to cost overruns, missed  schedules, and mediocre acquisition performance."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"All of these have an  effect on budget, security, and efficient use of resources; for  example, ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ According to DHS' Fiscal Year 2014 Agency Financial Report, the  Department's fiscal year 2014 obligations for ``Contractual Services  and Supplies'' were about $22.6 billion and its obligations for  ``Acquisition of Assets'' were about $3.1 billion."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) did not effectively          plan and manage employee housing in Ajo, Arizona, and made          decisions that resulted in additional costs to the Federal          Government, spending about $680,000 for each house that was          built, which was significantly more than the Ajo average home          price of $86,500."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We identified about $4.6 million CBP spent on          the project that could have been put to better use.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"(CBP Did          Not Effectively Plan and Manage Employee Housing in Ajo,          Arizona (Revised), OIG-14-131)We recently reported that although CBP's Unmanned Aircraft          System program contributes to border security, after 8 years,          CBP cannot prove that the program is effective because it has          not developed performance measures."

"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"CBP anticipated using the          unmanned aircraft to patrol more than 23,000 hours per year,          but the aircraft logged only a combined total of 5,102 hours,          or about 80 percent less than what was anticipated."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As a          result, CBP has invested significant funds in a program that          has not achieved the expected results, and it cannot          demonstrate how much the program has improved border security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The $443 million CBP plans to spend on program expansion could          be put to better use by investing in alternatives, such as          manned aircraft and ground surveillance assets."

CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Since the contract was awarded, however, the number of CBP          aircraft maintained, annual flight hours, and the average age          of the aircraft fleet have decreased, while contract costs          increased."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We were not able to reconcile maintenance labor          hours with the hours the contractor charged CBP because of          inconsistent and unreliable data.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"(U.S. Customs and Border          Protection's Management of National Aviation Maintenance          Activities, Management Advisory)     Given the magnitude and risks of the Department's acquisitions, we  will continue to invest resources in this critical area; for instance,In fiscal year 2015, we plan to audit CBP's acquisition of          an integrated fixed tower (IFT) system."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"IFT systems are          intended to assist agents in detecting, tracking, identifying,          and classifying items of interest along our borders through a          series of fixed-sensor towers."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In February 2014, CBP awarded          $145 million to begin work on the IFT acquisition program, a          spin-off of CBP's $1 billion SBInet acquisition."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The          acquisition is currently in schedule breach.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"An audit at this          point in the program's life cycle will be useful in identifying          program challenges and may help prevent further schedule          breaches.We are also planning an audit to determine whether the USCG          is effectively managing the acquisition of eight Legend-class          National Security Cutters, which will replace its 1960s-era          High-Endurance Cutters."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In 2012, GAO reported that the cost of          the USCG's plan to acquire the final two cutters is not covered          by the USCG's current 5-year budget plan."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thus, there may be a          significant mismatch between expected capital investment          funding and the estimated life-cycle costs for the project."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As these examples illustrate, we are moving towards a more  proactive approach by performing audits throughout the acquisition  process."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This approach would allow for course corrections early in the  acquisition life cycle before full investment in a program occurs-- addressing cost, schedule, and performance problems as they occur, thus  protecting a long-term investment."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Cybersecurity and IT Management     DHS continues to face challenges in protecting its IT  infrastructure, as well as ensuring that its infrastructure supports  its mission needs and operates efficiently."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Recent audits highlight  some of these challenges:As we reported in December 2014, the Department made          progress in improving its information security program."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Although it has transitioned to a risk-based approach for          managing IT security, the components' lack of compliance with          existing security policies and weaknesses in DHS' oversight and          enforcement of these policies undermines the Department's          efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Additionally, DHS and its components continued to          operate information systems without the proper authority,          hindering protection of sensitive information."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,There are some          indications that DHS may not be properly inventorying its          systems or that components may be procuring or developing new          systems independently.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Components also did not mitigate          security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"(Evaluation of          DHS' Information Security Program for Fiscal Year 2014, OIG-15-         16)In July 2014, the National Protection and Programs          Directorate (NPPD) made progress expanding its Enhanced          Cybersecurity program to share cyber threat information with          qualified Commercial Service Providers and ultimately to 16          critical infrastructure sectors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,But NPPD's limited outreach          and resources slowed the expansion.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"NPPD also relied on manual          reviews and analyses to share cyber threat information, which          led to inconsistent quality in cyber threat indicators."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The system's 29          commercial software products make it difficult to make changes          in the system.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Although ELIS was designed to improve          efficiency, time studies showed that adjudicating using paper-         based processes was faster than using the complex computer          system."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"USCIS staff also said it takes longer to process          adjudications using the Enterprise Document Management System          (EDMS), which they use to view and search electronic copies of          paper-based immigration case files."

"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Grant Management (FEMA)     FEMA continues to experience challenges managing the immense and  risky disaster assistance program.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Currently, every State and most of  the U.S. possessions have open disasters that include more than 100,000  grant applicants spending more than $50 billion on more than 600,000  disaster assistance projects."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Last year, we issued Capping Report: FY  2013 FEMA Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation Grant and Subgrant  Audits (OIG-14-102-D), which summarized the results of our disaster  assistance audits for the last 5 years."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Of the $5.9 billion we audited,  disaster assistance recipients did not properly spend $1.36 billion, or  an average of 23 percent, of the disaster assistance grants."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Department also provides Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP)  funds to State, territory, local, and Tribal governments to enhance  their ability to respond to terrorist attacks and other disasters."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Since 2005, we have conducted 74 separate audits covering more than $7  billion in HSGP funds awarded to all 50 States, 6 urban areas, 5 U.S.  territories, and the District of Columbia."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Although we determined that  in most instances the States complied with applicable laws and  regulations, we issued more than 600 recommendations for improvement to  FEMA, almost 90 percent of which have been resolved."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Most of the  recommendations were related to strategic homeland security planning,  timely obligation of grant funds, financial management and reporting,  and sub-grantee compliance monitoring."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We will continue to look for ways to help FEMA improve grant  management in fiscal year 2015.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For instance, we are currently  undertaking a capstone review to measure the impact of FEMA's  corrective actions as they specifically address these recurring  challenges."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We anticipate that our assessment will further strengthen  the level of National preparedness by helping to better inform the  agency's future administration and investment of taxpayer dollars.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We are also conducting an audit of approximately $2 billion awarded  through FEMA's Assistance to Firefighters Grant and Staffing for  Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grants programs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"These grants are  awarded directly to fire departments (volunteer, combination, and  career), unaffiliated Emergency Medical Service (EMS) organizations, or  volunteer firefighter interest organizations."
"

CHRG-114hhrg94109,The audit will determine  if FEMA ensures that these grant funds are expended appropriately.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"challenges Meeting the Risk     We must focus our limited resources on issues that make a  difference, especially those that may have a significant impact on the  Department's ability to fulfill its strategic missions."

CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Once we identify the high-impact  areas, we evaluate all the projects that have been proposed throughout  the previous year."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As we planned our work for fiscal year 2015, we began with two  priorities: To aid the Department in achieving its critical missions  and priorities and to ensure the proper stewardship and integrity of  Department programs and resources."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We also conduct legislatively- mandated work and make an earnest effort to address the concerns of  Congress and the Department, along with our other stakeholders."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In  fiscal year 2015, our work will focus on determining the effectiveness  of the Department's efforts to: (1) Prevent terrorism and enhance  security; (2) enforce and administer our immigration laws; (3) secure  and manage our borders; (4) strengthen National preparedness and  resilience to disasters; and (5) safeguard and secure the Nation's  cyber space."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We will also continue our efforts to promote management  stewardship and ensure program integrity.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Our Annual Performance Plan and our current list of Ongoing  Projects are published on our website to better inform the Congress and  the public regarding our work.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Audit Follow-up     Audit follow-up is an integral part of good management; it is a  shared responsibility of both auditors and agency management officials.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Department has made great strides in closing recommendations.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For  example, as shown in the following chart and attachment 1, DHS reduced  the number of unresolved, open recommendations more than 6 months old  from a high of 691 in fiscal year 2011 to 94 in fiscal year 2014."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In  parallel, the number of recommendations categorized as ``resolved- open'' (recommendations that the Department agreed to but has not yet  implemented) steadily declined from a high of 1,663 in fiscal year 2011  to 736 in fiscal year 2014."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"DHS's goal is to have zero financial  statement-related recommendations categorized as ``open-unresolved'' by  March 30, 2015."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,This progress largely results from increased focus by  the Department through the audit liaisons and increased communication  with our office; we sincerely appreciate the personnel and resources  the Department has dedicated to this effort.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In addition, we recently  began publishing a quarterly report of open recommendations over 6  months old on our public website in an effort to make this process more  transparent to Congress and the public.We need to do more to ensure that Department and component  management fully implements corrective actions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"To that end, we are  initiating ``verification reviews.''"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"These limited-scope reviews will  focus on our most crucial recommendations, examining whether the  recommendations were implemented and whether the actions taken had the  intended effect; for example,One of our verification reviews will determine if USCG          implemented recommendations from our 2012 audit on the USCG's          Sentinel Class Fast Response Cutter (FRC)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In September 2008,          the USCG awarded an $88.2 million fixed-price contract for the          detailed design and construction of the lead FRC."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The estimated          $1.5 billion contract contains 6 options to build a maximum of          34 cutters.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We found that USCG's schedule-driven strategy          allowed construction of the FRCs to start before operational,          design, and technical risks were resolved."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Consequently, six          FRCs under construction needed modification, which increased          the total cost of the acquisition by $6.9 million and caused          schedule delays of at least 270 days for each cutter."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,This          aggressive acquisition strategy also allowed the USCG to          procure 12 FRCs before testing in actual operations.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We made          four recommendations designed to eliminate this risk in future          acquisitions and one recommendation to address the current FRC          acquisition.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"(U.S. Coast Guard's Acquisition of the Sentinel          Class--Fast Response Cutter, OIG-12-68)We will also follow up on the recommendations from our          report on DHS' oversight of interoperable communications."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"During the audit, we tested DHS radios to determine whether DHS          components could talk to each other in the event of an          emergency."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,They could not.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Only 1 of 479 radio users we          tested--or less than 1 percent--could access and use the          specified common channel to communicate.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Further, of the 382          radios tested, only 20 percent (78) contained all the correct          program settings for the common channel."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In our verification          review, we will determine whether the Department created a          structure with the necessary authority to ensure that the          components achieve interoperability, as well as policies and          procedures to standardize Department-wide radio activities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"(DHS' Oversight of Interoperable Communications, OIG-13-06)     We believe verification reviews such as these will result in  increased commitment by the components to enact change."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Transparency of Reports     The Inspector General Act contemplates that my reports, to the  greatest possible extent, be available to the public."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Openness and  transparency are critical to good government, and the Act allows me to  publish my reports except in three narrow circumstances: First, where  disclosure of the information is specifically prohibited by law;  second, where specifically prohibited from disclosure by Executive  Order in the interest of National defense, National security, or in the  conduct of foreign affairs; and third, where part of an on-going  criminal investigation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Department often raises objections to the publication of  certain information in our reports, often marking parts of our reports  as ``For Official Use Only'' or ``Law Enforcement Sensitive.''"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"These  designations are not recognized in the law, and in my experience they  risk being used to attempt to avoid revealing information that is  embarrassing to the agency involved."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, sometimes such  information, if disclosed, could cause harm to DHS programs and  operations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In those situations, I use my discretion to redact information in  our public report."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, in order to properly exercise my discretion  in an informed and responsible manner, I require such requests to come  from the component or agency head, coupled with an articulation of the  actual, specific harm that would result from disclosure."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Too often, the  fear of harm is highly speculative, and fails to balance the need for  transparency against the risks of disclosure."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Recently, we have had issues with the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) designating certain material as ``Sensitive  Security Information'' (SSI) within an audit report concerning the  information technology operations at John F. Kennedy airport in New  York."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The designation of SSI is in the absolute and unreviewable  discretion of the administrator of TSA and improper disclosure of it  carries with it civil and administrative penalties.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"What was especially  troubling about this episode, in my view, was the length of time it  took--nearly 6 months--to get a resolution of the issue, the fact that  my security experts who wrote the report were confident that the  general and non-specific manner in which they wrote the report would  not compromise TSA's computer security, and that the similar  information had been published in previous audit reports without  objection."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The SSI designation is a useful tool to protect sensitive  transportation security information in a manner that gives some  flexibility to TSA.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, I am worried that SSI can be misused, as I  believe it has been here, to prevent embarrassment."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We intend to  conduct a formal review of TSA's administration of the SSI program, and  report those results to the Secretary and the Congressional committees  with oversight over the program."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Resources     The budget for our office is relatively tiny--we represent just  0.23 percent of the DHS budget, yet we have an outsize impact on the  operation of the Department."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For every dollar given to the OIG, we return more than $7 in  savings, as reflected by the statutory performance measures set forth  in the Inspector General Act."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This vastly understates our performance,  because much of our best work--audit and inspections reports that shed  light on problematic aspects of programs, for example--don't carry with  it a cost savings, but the value to the American taxpayer is  incalculable."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Notwithstanding the demonstrated contributions of our office, our  budget has actually shrunk by about 1 percent since fiscal year 2012."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As a result, our on-board strength from fiscal year 2012 to this year  has decreased by about 15 percent."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We have been forced to cut training  to less than a third of what we have determined to be appropriate,  reducing our ability to do our job and decreasing morale."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This includes  training for our auditors necessary under the Inspector General Act, as  well as training for our Special Agents to keep them safe."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Yet, during this same time, DHS' authorized workforce grew by about  5,000, representing a 2.3 percent increase."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Department continues to  grow, but the Inspector General's office--the one entity within the  Department designed to save money and create efficiency--shrinks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This, I believe, represents a false economy."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,working with congress     We are proud of our work and the success we have had pointing out  challenges the Department needs to overcome and recommending ways to  resolve issues and improve programs and operations.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, it is your  legislative efforts that enhance the significance of our work and  create an even greater impact on the Department."

CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The bill requires DHS to use its UAS for          surveillance of the entire Southern Border and report          performance indicators such as flight hours, detections,          apprehensions, and seizures."

CHRG-114hhrg94109,"It also prevents DHS from          procuring additional UAS until it operates its current fleet          for at least 23,000 hours annually."

CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Good morning, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member  Watson Coleman, and Members of the subcommittee."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I appreciate  the opportunity to testify at today's hearing to discuss GAO's  work on DHS's efforts to strengthen and integrate its  management functions.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Since 2003, GAO has issued hundreds of reports addressing  the range of DHS's mission and management functions, and we  have made about 2,200 recommendations to strengthen the  Department's management and performance measurement, among  other things."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"DHS has implemented more than 69 percent of these  recommendations, and has actions under way to address others."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"GAO also regularly reports to Congress on Government  operations that we have identified as high-risk because of  their greater vulnerability to fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement or the need for transformation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In 2003, we  designated implementing and transforming DHS as high-risk  because the Department had to transform 22 agencies into one  Department, and the failure to address associated risks could  have serious consequences for U.S., National, and economic  security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"With DHS's maturation and evolution, in our 2013 high-risk  update, we narrowed the scope of the high-risk area to focus on  strengthening DHS management functions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"These functions include  human capital, acquisition, information technology, and  financial management."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We also changed the name of the area to  strengthening DHS management functions.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"My remarks today will focus on two areas, DHS's progress  and remaining actions to strengthen its management functions  and cross-cutting issues or themes that have affected DHS's  efforts to implement its missions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"First, DHS has made progress in meeting our criteria for  removal from the high-risk list."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Specifically in our 2015 high- risk update, which we issued earlier this month, we found that  DHS has met two of our criteria, demonstrating leadership  commitment and having a corrective action plan."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"DHS has  partially met the other three criteria, having the capacity to  resolve the risks, a framework to monitor progress, and  demonstrated sustained progress."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,GAO and DHS have agreed to 30 actions and outcomes across  DHS's management functions that the Department must meet to  address the high-risk designation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS has fully or mostly  addressed just less than half of these actions and outcomes and  has partially addressed or initiated activities to address the  others.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, within acquisition management, the Department  has taken action to establish effective component-level  acquisition capability, but more work is needed to demonstrate  that major acquisition programs are on track to achieve cost,  schedule, and capability goals."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Further, within human capital management, DHS has developed  and made progress in implementing a strategic human capital  plan."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, DHS has considerable work ahead to improve  employee morale."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Overall, while DHS has made progress in addressing those  issues that contribute to its designation as high-risk, DHS  needs to continue to demonstrate measurable and sustainable  progress in implementing corrective actions and achieving those  actions and outcomes that we and the Department have  identified."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Second, we have identified various themes that have  impacted DHS's progress in implementing its mission functions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Those themes include leading and coordinating the Homeland  Security Enterprise, and strategically managing risks and  assessing Homeland Security efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"While DHS has made important progress in these themes, they  continue to affect the Department's implementation efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For  example, while DHS has made important strides in coordinating  efforts with Homeland Security partners in various mission  areas, our work has shown that DHS could further improve its  coordination and outreach with Federal, State, local, and other  partners, and with the public, such as in how DHS handles and  processes FOIA requests."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Further, DHS and its components have strengthened their  risk and performance assessments of various programs and  initiatives."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, opportunities exist for the Department  and its components to improve their risk assessment efforts in  such areas as covert testing along the border and to strengthen  their planning efforts in such areas as St. Elizabeths  headquarters consolidation project."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"GAO has made recommendations to the Department in all of  these areas and others, and as DHS continues to implement  actions in response to these recommendations, we will monitor  the Department's progress."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This concludes my prepared statement, and I would be happy  to answer any questions that Members may have."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,[The prepared statement of Ms.

"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Gambler follows:]                  Prepared Statement of Rebecca Gambler                            February 26, 2015     Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Watson Coleman, and Members of the  subcommittee: Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Department  of Homeland Security's (DHS) on-going efforts to strengthen and  integrate its management functions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In the 12 years since the  Department's creation, DHS has implemented key homeland security  operations, achieved important goals and milestones, and grown to more  than 240,000 employees and approximately $60 billion in budget  authority."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We have issued hundreds of reports addressing the range of  DHS's missions and management functions, and our work has identified  gaps and weaknesses in the Department's operational and implementation  efforts, as well as opportunities to strengthen their efficiency and  effectiveness."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Since 2003, we have made approximately 2,200  recommendations to DHS to strengthen program management, performance  measurement efforts, and management processes, among other things."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS  has implemented more than 69 percent of these recommendations and has  actions under way to address others.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We also report regularly to Congress on Government operations that  we identified as high-risk because of their increased vulnerability to  fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or the need for transformation  to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In 2003,  we designated implementing and transforming DHS as high-risk because  DHS had to transform 22 agencies--several with major management  challenges--into one department, and failure to address associated  risks could have serious consequences for U.S. National and economic  security.\1\ Given the significant effort required to build and  integrate a department as large and complex as DHS, our initial high- risk designation addressed the Department's initial transformation and  subsequent implementation efforts, to include associated management and  programmatic challenges.\2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ GAO, High-Risk Series: An Update, GAO-03-119 (Washington, DC:  January 2003)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,\2\ DHS also has responsibility for other areas we have designated  as high-risk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Specifically, in 2005, we designated establishing  effective mechanisms for sharing and managing terrorism-related  information to protect the homeland as high-risk, involving a number of  Federal departments, to include DHS."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In 2006, we identified the  National Flood Insurance Program as high-risk."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Further, in 2003, we  expanded the scope of the high-risk area involving Federal information  security, which was initially designated as high-risk in 1997, to  include the protection of the Nation's computer-reliant critical  infrastructure."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"See GAO, High-Risk Series: An Update, GAO-09-271  (Washington, DC: January 2009); High-Risk Series: An Update, GAO-07-310  (Washington, DC: January 2007); and High-Risk Series: An Update, GAO- 05-207 (Washington, DC: January 2005)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Since 2003, the focus of the Implementing and Transforming DHS  high-risk area has evolved in tandem with DHS's maturation and  evolution."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In September 2011, we reported in our assessment of DHS's  progress and challenges 10 years after the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001, (9/11) that the Department had implemented key  homeland security operations and achieved important goals in many areas  to create and strengthen a foundation to reach its potential.\3\  However, we also reported that continuing weaknesses in DHS's  management functions had been a key theme impacting the Department's  implementation efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"While challenges remain for DHS across its  range of missions, the Department has made considerable progress in  transforming its original component agencies into a single Cabinet- level department and positioning itself to achieve its full potential."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Leadership commitment (met).--In our 2015 report, we found that the  Secretary and deputy secretary of Homeland Security, the under  secretary for management at DHS, and other senior officials have  continued to demonstrate commitment and top leadership support for  addressing the Department's management challenges."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We also found that  they have taken actions to institutionalize this commitment to help  ensure the long-term success of the Department's efforts.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example,  in April 2014, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum  entitled Strengthening Departmental Unity of Effort, committing to,  among other things, improving DHS's planning, programming, budgeting,  and execution processes through strengthened Departmental structures  and increased capability.\7\ Senior DHS officials, including the deputy  secretary and under secretary for management, have also routinely met  with us over the past 6 years to discuss the Department's plans and  progress in addressing this high-risk area."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"During this time, we  provided specific feedback on the Department's efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We concluded  that it will be important for DHS to maintain its current level of top  leadership support and commitment to ensure continued progress in  successfully executing its corrective actions through completion.

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Corrective action plan (met).--We found that DHS has established a  plan for addressing this high-risk area.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Specifically, in a September  2010 letter to DHS, we identified and DHS agreed to achieve 31 actions  and outcomes that are critical to addressing the challenges within the  Department's management areas and in integrating those functions across  the Department."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In March 2014, we updated the actions and outcomes in  collaboration with DHS to reduce overlap and ensure their continued  relevance and appropriateness."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,These updates resulted in a reduction  from 31 to 30 total actions and outcomes.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Toward achieving the actions  and outcomes, DHS issued its initial Integrated Strategy for High-Risk  Management in January 2011 and has since provided updates to its  strategy in seven later versions, most recently in October 2014."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The  integrated strategy includes key management initiatives and related  corrective actions plans for addressing DHS's management challenges and  the actions and outcomes we identified.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, the October 2014  strategy update includes an initiative focused on financial systems  improvement and modernization and an initiative focused on IT human  capital management."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"These initiatives support various actions and  outcomes, such as modernizing the U.S. Coast Guard's financial  management system and implementing an IT human capital strategic plan,  respectively."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We concluded in our 2015 report that DHS's strategy and  approach to continuously refining actionable steps to implementing the  outcomes, if implemented effectively and sustained, should provide a  path for DHS to be removed from our high-risk list."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Capacity (partially met).--In October 2014, DHS identified that it  had resources needed to implement 7 of the 11 initiatives the  Department had under way to achieve the actions and outcomes, but did  not identify sufficient resources for the 4 remaining initiatives."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In  addition, our prior work has identified specific capacity gaps that  could undermine achievement of management outcomes."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, in  April 2014, we reported that DHS needed to increase its cost-estimating  capacity and that the Department had not approved baselines for 21 of  46 major acquisition programs.\8\ These baselines--which establish  cost, schedule, and capability parameters--are necessary to accurately  assess program performance."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thus, in our 2015 report, we concluded that  DHS needs to continue to identify resources for the remaining  initiatives; work to mitigate shortfalls and prioritize initiatives, as  needed; and communicate to senior leadership critical resource gaps."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Framework to monitor progress (partially met).--In our 2015 report  we found that DHS established a framework for monitoring its progress  in implementing the integrated strategy it identified for addressing  the 30 actions and outcomes.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In the June 2012 update to the Integrated  Strategy for High-Risk Management, DHS included, for the first time,  performance measures to track its progress in implementing all of its  key management initiatives."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS continued to include performance  measures in its October 2014 update.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, we also found that the  Department can strengthen this framework for monitoring a certain area."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In particular, according to DHS officials, as of November 2014, they  were establishing a monitoring program that will include assessing  whether financial management systems modernization projects for key  components that DHS plans to complete in 2019 are following industry  best practices and meet users' needs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Effective implementation of these  modernization projects is important because, until they are complete,  the Department's current systems will not effectively support financial  management operations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As we concluded in our 2015 report, moving  forward, DHS will need to closely track and independently validate the  effectiveness and sustainability of its corrective actions and make  mid-course adjustments, as needed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Demonstrated, sustained progress (partially met).--We found in our  2015 report that DHS has made important progress in strengthening its  management functions, but needs to demonstrate sustainable, measurable  progress in addressing key challenges that remain within and across  these functions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In particular, we found that DHS has implemented a  number of actions demonstrating the Department's progress in  strengthening its management functions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, DHS has  strengthened its enterprise architecture program (or blueprint) to  guide and constrain IT acquisitions and obtained a clean opinion on its  financial statements for 2 consecutive years, fiscal years 2013 and  2014."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, we also found that DHS continues to face significant  management challenges that hinder the Department's ability to  accomplish its missions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, DHS does not have the acquisition  management tools in place to consistently demonstrate whether its major  acquisition programs are on track to achieve their cost, schedule, and  capability goals."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In addition, DHS does not have modernized financial  management systems."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,This affects its ability to have ready access to  reliable information for informed decision making.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As we concluded in  our 2015 report, addressing these and other management challenges will  be a significant undertaking that will likely require several years,  but will be critical for the Department to mitigate the risks that  management weaknesses pose to mission accomplishment."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS Progress in Achieving Key High-Risk Actions and Outcomes     Key to addressing the Department's management challenges is DHS  demonstrating the ability to achieve sustained progress across the 30  actions and outcomes we identified and DHS agreed were needed to  address the high-risk area.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In our 2015 report, we found that DHS has  fully implemented 9 of these actions and outcomes, with additional work  remaining to fully address the remaining 21."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Achieving sustained  progress across the actions and outcomes, in turn, requires leadership  commitment, effective corrective action planning, adequate capacity  (that is, the people and other resources), and monitoring the  effectiveness and sustainability of supporting initiatives."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The 30 key  actions and outcomes include, among others, validating required  acquisition documents in accordance with a Department-approved,  knowledge-based acquisition process, and sustaining clean audit  opinions for at least 2 consecutive years on Department-wide financial  statements and internal controls."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We further found that DHS has made important progress across all of  its management functions and significant progress in the area of  management integration.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In particular, DHS has made important progress  in several areas to fully address 9 actions and outcomes, 5 of which it  has sustained as fully implemented for at least 2 years."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For instance,  DHS fully met 1 outcome for the first time by obtaining a clean opinion  on its financial statements for 2 consecutive years and fully met  another outcome by establishing sufficient component-level acquisition  capability."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It also sustained full implementation of another outcome by  continuing to use performance measures to assess progress made in  achieving Department-wide management integration.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"DHS has also mostly  addressed an additional 5 actions and outcomes, meaning that a small  amount of work remains to fully address them."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We also found that considerable work remains, however, in several  areas for DHS to fully achieve the remaining actions and outcomes and  thereby strengthen its management functions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Specifically, DHS has  partially addressed 12 and initiated 4 of the actions and outcomes."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As  previously mentioned, addressing some of these actions and outcomes,  such as modernizing the Department's financial management systems and  improving employee morale, are significant undertakings that will  likely require multi-year efforts."
"

"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"*** ``Partially addressed''.--Progress is measurable, but significant work remains."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"**** ``Initiated''.--Activities have been initiated to address the outcome, but it is too early to report   progress."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"***** Although March 2014 updates to most functional areas were minor, there were more significant revisions to   the financial management actions and outcomes, with some outcomes revised or dropped and others added."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,These   revisions prevent the financial management actions and outcomes from being comparable on a one-for-one basis   with those of prior years.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Accordingly, our ratings of DHS's progress in addressing financial management   actions and outcomes are not an indication of a downgrade to the Department's progress."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Acquisition management.--In our 2015 report, we found that DHS has  fully addressed 1 of the 5 acquisition management outcomes, partially  addressed 3 outcomes, and initiated actions to address the remaining  outcome."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, DHS has recently taken a number of actions to  fully address establishing effective component-level acquisition  capability."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,These actions include initiating: (1) Monthly Component  Acquisition Executive staff forums in March 2014 to provide guidance  and share best practices and (2) assessments of component policies and  processes for managing acquisitions.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"DHS has also initiated efforts to  validate required acquisition documents in accordance with a knowledge- based acquisition process, but this remains a major challenge for the  Department."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"A knowledge-based approach provides developers with  information needed to make sound investment decisions, and it would  help DHS address significant challenges we have identified across its  acquisition programs.\9\ DHS's acquisition policy largely reflects key  acquisition management practices, but the Department has not  implemented it consistently."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, in March 2014, we found that  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had not fully followed DHS  policy regarding testing for the integrated fixed towers being deployed  on the Arizona border."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As a result, DHS does not have complete  information on how the towers will operate once they are fully  deployed.\10\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \9\ In our past work examining weapon acquisition issues and best  practices for product development, we have found that leading  commercial firms pursue an acquisition approach that is anchored in  knowledge, whereby high levels of product knowledge are demonstrated by  critical points in the acquisition process."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     In addition, in our 2015 report we found that DHS continues to  assess and address whether appropriate numbers of trained acquisition  personnel are in place at the Department and component levels, an  outcome it has partially addressed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Further, while DHS has initiated  efforts to demonstrate that major acquisition programs are on track to  achieve their cost, schedule, and capability goals, DHS officials have  acknowledged it will be years before this outcome has been fully  addressed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Much of the necessary program information is not yet  consistently available or up-to-date.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"IT management.--In our 2015 report, we found that DHS has fully  addressed 2 of the 6 IT management outcomes, mostly addressed another  3, and partially addressed the remaining 1."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, DHS has  finalized a directive to establish its tiered governance and portfolio  management structure for overseeing and managing its IT investments,  and annually reviews each of its portfolios and the associated  investments to determine the most efficient allocation of resources  within each of the portfolios."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS has also implemented its IT  Strategic Human Capital Plan at the enterprise level.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,This includes  developing an IT specialist leadership competency gap workforce  analysis and a DHS IT career path pilot.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, as DHS has not yet  determined the extent to which the component chief information officers  have implemented the enterprise human capital plan's objectives and  goals, DHS's capacity to achieve this outcome is unclear."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Additionally,  we found that DHS continues to take steps to enhance its information  security program."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, while the Department obtained a clean  opinion on its financial statements, in November 2014, the Department's  financial statement auditor reported that continued flaws in security  controls such as those for access controls, configuration management,  and segregation of duties were a material weakness for fiscal year 2014  financial reporting.\11\ Thus, the Department needs to remediate the  material weakness in information security controls reported by its  financial statement auditor."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \11\ A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of  deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable  possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial  statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a  timely basis."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination  of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a  material weakness, but is important enough to merit attention by those  charged with governance."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Financial management.--In our 2015 report, we found that DHS has  fully addressed 2 financial management outcomes, partially addressed 3,  and initiated 3.\12\ Most notably, DHS received a clean audit opinion  on its financial statements for 2 consecutive years, fiscal years 2013  and 2014, fully addressing 2 outcomes."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As of November 2014, DHS was  working toward addressing a third outcome--establishing effective  internal control over financial reporting."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We reported in September  2013 that DHS needs to eliminate all material weaknesses at the  Department level, including weaknesses related to financial management  systems, before its financial auditor can affirm that controls are  effective.\13\ However, as we reported in our 2015 report, DHS has yet  to identify and commit the resources needed for remediating the  remaining material weaknesses."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As we reported in September 2013,  according to DHS's auditors, the existence of these material weaknesses  limits DHS's ability to process, store, and report financial data in a  manner that ensures accuracy, confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of data without substantial manual intervention."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This, in  turn, increases the risk that human error may cause material  misstatements in the financial statements.\14\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \12\ As previously discussed, in March 2014, we updated the actions  and outcomes in collaboration with DHS to reduce overlap and ensure  their continued relevance and appropriateness."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,These updates resulted  in a reduction from 9 to 8 total financial management actions and  outcomes.

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     We also found in our 2015 report that DHS needs to modernize key  components' financial management systems and comply with financial  management system requirements.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The components' financial management  system modernization efforts are at various stages due, in part, to a  bid protest and the need to resolve critical stability issues with a  legacy financial system before moving forward with system modernization  efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For fiscal year 2014, auditors reported that persistent and  pervasive financial system functionality conditions exist at multiple  components and that DHS continues to rely on compensating controls and  complex manual work-arounds due to serious legacy financial system  issues.\15\ We concluded that without sound controls and systems, DHS  faces long-term challenges in obtaining and sustaining a clean audit  opinion on internal control over financial reporting, and ensuring its  financial management systems generate reliable, useful, and timely  information for day-to-day decision making."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Human capital management.--In our 2015 report, we found that DHS  has fully addressed 1 human capital management outcome, mostly  addressed 2, and partially addressed the remaining 4."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, the  Secretary of Homeland Security signed a human capital strategic plan in  2011 that DHS has since made sustained progress in implementing, fully  addressing this outcome."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We also found that DHS has actions under way  to identify current and future human capital needs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, DHS has  considerable work ahead to improve employee morale."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, the  Office of Personnel Management's 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey  data showed that DHS's scores continued to decrease in all four  dimensions of the survey's index for human capital accountability and  assessment--job satisfaction, talent management, leadership and  knowledge management, and results-oriented performance culture."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS has  taken steps to identify where it has the most significant employee  satisfaction problems and developed plans to address those problems.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In  September 2012, we recommended, among other things, that DHS improve  its root-cause analysis efforts related to these plans.\16\ In December  2014, DHS reported actions under way to address our recommendations but  had not fully implemented them."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Given the sustained decrease in DHS  employee morale indicated by Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey data, as  we concluded in our 2015 report, it is particularly important that DHS  implement these recommendations and thereby help identify appropriate  actions to take to improve morale within its components and Department- wide."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     We have also found that DHS has developed and implemented  mechanisms to assess training programs but could take additional  actions.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, in September 2014, we found that DHS had  implemented component-specific and Department-wide training  programs.\17\ We also found that the five DHS components in our review  all had documented processes to evaluate their training programs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For  example, we found that DHS had established a five-tier, Department-wide  Leader Development Framework to build leadership skills across all  staff levels and implemented programs in support of two of the tiers."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Nonetheless, we found that various actions could better position the  Department to maximize the impact of its training efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For  instance, we found that while component officials generally identified  the Leader Development Framework as beneficial, DHS management could  benefit from improved information for identifying the need for and  making program improvements."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In support of the Leader Development  Framework, we recommended, among other things, that DHS clearly  identify Leader Development Program goals and ensure program  performance measures reflect key attributes."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS agreed and implemented  this recommendation in December 2014.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, to fully achieve this  outcome, DHS also needs to develop and make sustained progress in  implementing a formal training strategy, as well as issue Department- wide policies on training and development, among other things."

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Management integration.--In our 2015 report, we found that DHS has  sustained its progress in fully addressing 3 of 4 outcomes we  identified and agreed they are key to the Department's management  integration efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, in January 2011, DHS issued an  initial action plan to guide its management integration efforts--the  Integrated Strategy for High-Risk Management."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Since then, DHS has  generally made improvements to the strategy with each update based on  feedback we provided."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS has also shown important progress in  addressing the last and most significant management integration  outcome--to implement actions and outcomes in each management area to  develop consistent or consolidated processes and systems within and  across its management functional areas--but we found that considerable  work remains.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, the Secretary's April 2014 Strengthening  Departmental Unity of Effort memorandum highlighted a number of  initiatives designed to allow the Department to operate in a more  integrated fashion, such as the Integrated Investment Life-Cycle  Management initiative, to manage investments across the Department's  components and management functions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"DHS completed its pilot for a  portion of this initiative in March 2014 and, according to DHS's  Executive Director for Management Integration, has begun expanding its  application to new portfolios, such as border security and information  sharing, among others."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, given that these main management  integration initiatives are in the early stages of implementation and  contingent upon DHS following through with its plans, it is too early  to assess their impact."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"To achieve this outcome, we concluded that DHS  needs to continue to demonstrate sustainable progress integrating its  management functions within and across the Department and its  components."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In our 2015 report, we further concluded that in the coming years,  DHS needs to continue implementing its Integrated Strategy for High- Risk Management and show measurable, sustainable progress in  implementing its key management initiatives and corrective actions and  achieving outcomes."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In doing so, it will be important for DHS to:maintain its current level of top leadership support and          sustained commitment to ensure continued progress in executing          its corrective actions through completion;continue to implement its plan for addressing this high-risk          area and periodically report its progress to us and Congress;identify and work to mitigate any resource gaps, and          prioritize initiatives as needed to ensure it can implement and          sustain its corrective actions;closely track and independently validate the effectiveness          and sustainability of its corrective actions and make mid-         course adjustments as needed; andmake continued progress in achieving the 21 actions and          outcomes it has not fully addressed and demonstrate that          systems, personnel, and policies are in place to ensure that          progress can be sustained over time."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We will continue to monitor DHS's efforts in this high-risk area to  determine if the actions and outcomes are achieved and sustained over  the long term.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"key themes continue to impact dhs's progress in implementing its                             mission functions     In September 2011, we reported that our work had identified three  key themes that had impacted DHS's progress in implementing its mission  functions since it began operations: (1) Executing and integrating its  management functions for results, (2) leading and coordinating the  homeland security enterprise, and (3) strategically managing risks and  assessing homeland security efforts.\18\ As previously discussed, DHS  has made important progress with respect to the first theme by  strengthening and integrating its management functions, but  considerable work remains."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Our recent work indicates that DHS has  similarly made progress related to the other two themes of leading and  coordinating the Homeland Security Enterprise and strategically  managing risk and assessing homeland security efforts, but that these  two themes continue to impact the Department's progress in implementing  its mission functions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \18\ GAO-11-881.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Leading and coordinating the homeland security enterprise.--As we  reported in September 2011, while DHS is one of a number of entities  with a role in securing the homeland, it has significant leadership and  coordination responsibilities for managing efforts across the homeland  security enterprise.\19\ To satisfy these responsibilities, it is  critically important that DHS develop, maintain, and leverage effective  partnerships with its stakeholders while at the same time addressing  DHS-specific responsibilities in satisfying its missions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Before DHS  began operations, we reported that to secure the Nation, DHS must form  effective and sustained partnerships among components and also with a  range of other entities, including Federal agencies, State and local  governments, the private and nonprofit sectors, and international  partners.\20\ DHS has made important strides in providing leadership  and coordinating efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, in June 2014, we reported on DHS  efforts to enhance border security by using collaborative mechanisms  such as the Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats to coordinate  border security efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Specifically, we reported that DHS and CBP had  coordinated border security efforts in: (1) Information sharing, (2)  resource targeting and prioritization, and (3) leveraging of assets."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, through the Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats,  interagency partners--including CBP, the Arizona Department of Public  Safety, and the Bureau of Land Management, among others--worked jointly  to target individuals and criminal organizations involved in illegal  cross-border activity.\21\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \19\ GAO-11-881."

CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     However, our recent work has also identified opportunities for DHS  to improve its partnerships."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, with respect to DHS's efforts  to enhance border security using collaborative mechanisms, in June  2014, we found that DHS had established performance measures and  reporting processes for the mechanisms, but opportunities existed to  strengthen the mechanisms."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For instance, we found that establishing  written agreements with its Federal, State, local, and Tribal partners  could help DHS address coordination challenges, such as limited  resource commitments and lack of common objectives, and recommended  that DHS establish such agreements."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS concurred and stated that it  planned to develop memoranda of understanding to better facilitate its  partnerships.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Further, in November 2014, we reported on DHS's  processing of Freedom of Information Act requests.\22\ We found, among  other things, that DHS lacked an important mechanism for effectively  facilitating public interaction with the Department on the handling of  Freedom of Information Act requests because the Department did not have  an updated regulation reflecting changes in how it processes these  requests.\23\ We recommended that DHS finalize and issue an updated DHS  Freedom of Information Act regulation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS concurred and reported  planned actions to implement this recommendation by April 2015.

CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, as we  reported in November 2014, important changes have occurred in how DHS  processes Freedom of Information Act requests since the Department  issued its regulation in 2003, and the regulation has not been updated  to reflect those changes."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Strategically managing risks and assessing homeland security  efforts.--As we reported in September 2011, risk management has been  widely supported by Congress and DHS as a management approach for  homeland security, enhancing the Department's ability to make informed  decisions and prioritize resource investments.\24\ Since DHS does not  have unlimited resources and cannot protect the Nation from every  conceivable threat, it must make risk-informed decisions regarding its  homeland security approaches and strategies."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As we have previously  reported, DHS issued the National Infrastructure Protection Plan in  2006 to provide the overarching approach for integrating the Nation's  critical infrastructure security and resilience activities into a  single National effort."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This plan, which DHS updated in 2009 and 2013,  sets forth a risk management framework and outlines the roles and  responsibilities of DHS with regard to critical infrastructure security  and resilience.\25\ Our recent work has further found that DHS offices  and components have continued to engage in risk management activities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, in September 2014, we reported that during fiscal years  2011 to 2013, DHS offices and components conducted or required  thousands of vulnerability assessments of critical infrastructure."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,These assessments can identify factors that render an asset or facility  susceptible to threats and hazards.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, we also found that DHS is  not well-positioned to integrate relevant assessments to, among other  things, support Nation-wide comparative risk assessments, because the  assessment tools and methods used vary in length, detail, and areas  assessed.\26\ In addition, our recent work has identified opportunities  for components to better strategically manage risks in various  programs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, in September 2014, we reported that CBP had a $1  million budget for covert operations of various activities--including  nuclear and radiological testing--covering fiscal years 2009 through  2013.\27\ We found that DHS had established a policy that requires that  components with limited resources make risk-informed decisions, but  that CBP testing did not inform capabilities across all border  locations, and CBP had not conducted a risk assessment that could  inform and prioritize the locations, materials, and technologies to be  tested through covert operations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We recommended that--to help ensure  that resources for covert operations provide reasonable assurance that  efforts to detect and interdict nuclear and radiological material  smuggled across the border are working as intended and appropriately  targeted--DHS conduct or use a risk assessment to inform the  Department's priorities for covert operations.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,DHS concurred and  reported that it plans to implement this recommendation in July 2015.

CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     In September 2011, we reported that limited strategic and program  planning, as well as assessment and evaluation to inform approaches and  investment decisions, had contributed to DHS programs not meeting  strategic needs or doing so effectively and efficiently.\28\ Our recent  work has indicated that strategic and program planning challenges  continue to affect implementation of some DHS programs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, in  September 2014, we reported on DHS headquarters consolidation efforts  and their management by DHS and the General Services Administration  (GSA).\29\ We found that DHS and GSA's planning for the consolidation  did not fully conform with leading capital decision-making practices  intended to help agencies effectively plan and procure assets."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"DHS and  GSA officials reported that they had taken some initial actions that  may facilitate consolidation planning in a manner consistent with  leading practices, but consolidation plans, which were finalized  between 2006 and 2009, had not been updated to reflect these changes."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"According to DHS and GSA officials, the funding gap between what was  requested and what was received from fiscal years 2009 through 2014 was  over $1.6 billion."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"According to these officials, this gap had escalated  estimated costs by over $1 billion--from $3.3 billion to $4.5 billion-- and delayed scheduled completion by over 10 years, from an original  completion date of 2015 to the current estimate of 2026."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, DHS  and GSA had not conducted a comprehensive assessment of current needs,  identified capability gaps, or evaluated and prioritized alternatives  to help them adapt consolidation plans to changing conditions and  address funding issues as reflected in leading practices."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We  recommended that DHS and GSA work jointly to assess these needs.
"
"

"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------     We also recently found that DHS had taken preliminary steps to  begin to understand the cyber risk to building and access controls  systems in Federal facilities, but that significant work remained, such  as developing a strategy to guide these efforts."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In particular, in  December 2014, we found that DHS lacked a strategy that: (1) Defines  the problem, (2) identifies roles and responsibilities, (3) analyzes  the resources needed, and (4) identifies a methodology for assessing  cyber risk to building and access controls systems in Federal  facilities.\30\ We concluded that the absence of a strategy that  clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of key components within  DHS had contributed to a lack of action within the Department."

"
"

"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The legislation provided rationale for the Department but left  many of the operational specifics for a later date.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Some of the  decisions made in haste did not translate well into  implementation and should be reconsidered as part of a  comprehensive reform effort.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In considering the case for change, it is worth noting that  under the leadership of Secretary Johnson the Department has  committed to building the capacities and institutions that will  be required."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"To this end, the Department is undertaking a Unity  of Effort campaign to address many of the deficiencies noted  over the Department's short history."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,These efforts are vital  and should be encouraged and enthusiastically supported.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Now, in my written testimony I make five recommendations  across critical areas: Authorities and responsibilities;  legislation and oversight; strategy formulation, planning,  effectiveness operations, and resource allocation; personnel  management, DHS identity, and culture; and, finally, management  and administration."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would like to highlight several of the recommendations  this morning.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So let me make three main points.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"First, a comprehensive review of the Department is in  order."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I call it a roles, missions, and functions review that  would result in an overarching framework for authorizing  legislation for DHS."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This is essential given that today many of  the Department's authorities and responsibilities are  overlapping, have gaps between them, or are unclear."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This  roles, missions, and functions analysis must also consider the  Homeland Security Enterprise which is that umbrella term that  encompasses the Department, its components, State, local,  Tribal, territorial entities, first responders and law  enforcement communities, and the private-sector bodies  responsible for managing critical infrastructure."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Second, in moving forward with reform and building on the  Unity of Effort initiative, some of the necessary changes can  be made from within the Department of Homeland Security, but  others will require external support and direction from  Congress and the White House."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Hard but necessary decisions will  need to be made.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Congressional oversight process must be  streamlined.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Today, over 120 committees, subcommittees,  caucuses, and commissions claim some degree of jurisdiction  over DHS."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Legislation in key areas such as privacy, immigration  reform, and cybersecurity must be provided."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Additionally, authorizing legislation for the Department  must be developed to institutionalize the change that is  currently under way."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Failure to do so risks losing the momentum  for DHS reform with a change of administrations.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Finally, third: Several process reforms are also needed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Additional emphasis must be made to link strategy, planning,  operations, and resources through the identification of key  mission areas and development of comprehensive strategies to  satisfy operational requirements."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This requires developing a  systems approach to these mission areas, identifying seams and  gaps, and applying appropriate resources to close these gaps  and build necessary capabilities."

"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Establishing clearer links between strategy and resources  should also include the development and submission to Congress  of what I call a Future Year Homeland Security Plan, or FYHSP,  similar to the future year defense plan submitted by DOD."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The  use of a FYHSP would ensure greater stability in DHS budgets  and programs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Acquisition reform will be important here as  well.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Research, development, and acquisition within the  Department must be fully linked."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In making recommendations for comprehensive reform of DHS,  I remain mindful that change will be difficult but very  necessary to strengthen and mature the enterprise and allow the  dedicated men and women who serve within the Department and  within the Homeland Security Enterprise to reach their full  potential."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I appreciate the opportunity to discuss recommendations to  improve the Department, and thereby the homeland security of  our Nation, and I look forward to your questions."

CHRG-114hhrg94109,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------                              February 2014                               introduction     Good morning, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Coleman, and  distinguished Members of the subcommittee."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I thank you for the  opportunity to testify today about the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), specifically about recommendations to improve the Department and  the Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the Department  of Homeland Security was formed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"With the Homeland Security Act of  2002, the third-largest Cabinet-level Department, composed of 22  disparate agencies, was established."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Given the rapidity with which the  Department was formed, it should be no surprise that the result was a  loose confederation of components--such as the Transportation Security  Administration, Secret Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), and U.S. Coast Guard, to name a few--overseen by a relatively  small number of underresourced Departmental staff."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Homeland  Security Act of 2002 provided the rationale for the Department but left  the many of the operational specifics for later.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Some of the decisions  made in haste did not translate well into implementation and should be  reconsidered as part of a comprehensive reform effort.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,These include  internal DHS and interagency conflicts with respect to several key  homeland security issues.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"While the Nation developed significant preparedness and response  capabilities since the establishment of the Department, more can and  must be done."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The largely smooth response to Superstorm Sandy in  November 2012 stands in stark contrast to the earlier preparedness and  response during Hurricane Katrina.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The successful management of the  surge in the flow of illegal aliens--especially unaccompanied minors-- across the Southwestern Border in the summer of 2014 demonstrated an  important ability to coordinate across the Government and  internationally.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Close collaboration between the private sector and the  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) on  emerging cybersecurity issues in several critical infrastructure  areas--including in the financial and energy sectors--also demonstrates  how far the Department has come.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Yet we continue to see evidence of both the complexity and the lack  of National preparedness across key mission spaces.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The response to the  Ebola outbreak provides evidence of the lack of National preparedness  with respect to biodefense, in terms of either naturally infectious  disease or deliberate use of biological weapons."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The fire in a  Washington Metro station several weeks ago continues to highlight  critical shortfalls in first responder and law enforcement  communications and situational awareness during emergencies.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The  growing numbers of cybersecurity incidents demonstrate that the  Department is playing catch-up in this mission space.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The continued  proliferation of technology is allowing State-like capabilities to fall  into the hands of small groups and even individuals; we should expect  these trends to continue.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In considering the case for change, it is worth noting that under  the leadership of Secretary Johnson, the Department has committed to  building the capacities and institutions that will be required."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Under  his direction, the Department is undertaking a ``Unity of Effort''  campaign to address many of the deficiencies noted over the  Department's short history, including a greater emphasis on strategy  and collaboration among operational components."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,These efforts are  critical and must continue.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Therefore, my testimony today is both to  reinforce these efforts and to identify additional opportunities for  reform."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In thinking of the potential for DHS reform, it is useful to  consider another Governmental reform effort that is now almost 3  decades old."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act made the broadest and most  sweeping changes to the Pentagon since its establishment by the  National Security Act of 1947.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In the years since, it has stood as the  embodiment of the best type of legislative oversight--implementing  thoughtful, serious, and reasoned reforms to address specific  bureaucratic failures and identifying inefficiencies and service  rivalries within the Department of Defense (DoD)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The act worked and,  as a result, improved the functioning of the largest Department in the  Federal Government."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The same spirit should be applied to reforming DHS  and the HSE.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The use of the Goldwater-Nichols analogy is not to imply that the  DoD model can or should be directly applied to DHS.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In fact, DHS reform  is actually far more complex."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Unlike DoD, which has a strict  hierarchical command structure, DHS leads through guidance, use of  standards, and developing coalitions between Federal, State, local,  Tribal, and territorial entities, as well as industry, other non- Governmental organizations, and international actors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"It cannot direct  these elements, but must rely on them to collaboratively implement  homeland security initiatives."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As a result, DHS reform can apply many  of the lessons learned in Goldwater-Nichols, but must develop a unique  outlook toward reform."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"recommendations     My recommendations for DHS reform focus on five critical areas: (1)  Authorities and responsibilities; (2) legislation and oversight; (3)  strategy formulation, planning, effectiveness of operations, and  resource allocation; (4) personnel management, DHS identity, and  culture; and (5) management and administration."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Some of these changes  can be made from within DHS, but others will require external support  and direction from Congress and the White House."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Additionally, while  some recommendations could be implemented directly, in other cases  innovative alternatives must be developed and compared before a course  of action is determined."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Authorities and responsibilities must be clarified.--This begins  with a comprehensive analysis of the roles, missions, and functions of  the Department and the HSE."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Today, many of the authorities and  responsibilities are overlapping, have gaps between them, or are  unclear."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Over the past decade, legislation has been appliqued onto the  original Homeland Security Act in an uncoordinated manner."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This must be  rectified through comprehensive authorizing legislation, something that  the Department has not had since its inception in 2002."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In addition,  the role of the Department versus FEMA in a crisis is another issue  that must be reconsidered."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Having FEMA with a direct report to the  President in times of crisis confuses lines of authority and affects  all aspects of preparedness and response, from planning to operations  on the ground."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Authorities and responsibilities reform must also  institutionalize the change that is on-going in the Department through  the ``Unity of Effort'' initiative; this must be done through  comprehensive legislation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Without such legislation, the ``Unity of  Effort'' initiative will likely lose momentum, as other attempts at DHS  reform have done during transitional periods."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Oversight challenges and legislation shortfalls require several  important initiatives to be implemented.--The Congressional oversight  process must be streamlined; today, more than 120 committees,  subcommittees, caucuses, and commissions claim some degree of  jurisdiction over DHS."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This fractured oversight results in conflicting  guidance, micromanagement on low-level issues, a lack of strategic  direction, and overreporting."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Legislation serves to guide the efforts  of the Department.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In areas such as cybersecurity, technology policy,  and privacy, having a legal basis for developing policies, programs,  and regulations is essential."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In many of these emerging contentious  issues, this legislation is lacking."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Legislation would also be useful for enhancing the relationship  between the Department and State Governors.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"While the Stafford Act does  provide a systemic means for providing Federal natural disaster  assistance for State and local governments, other coordination  activities between the Federal and State governments could also be  formalized through legislation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Another useful addition to assist  Congress in its oversight process would be the requirement for DHS to  provide an annual submission (similar to the annual Secretary of  Defense Report required under Goldwater-Nichols); such a requirement  would institutionalize a strategy-to-resources discussion of ends,  ways, and means on a more regular basis than the 4-year Quadrennial  Homeland Security Review (QHSR)."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In considering a strategy to resources framework, several important  reforms should be considered.--The ``Unity of Effort'' initiative and  the accompanying Joint Requirements Council (JRC) are important first  steps."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Additional emphasis must be made to link strategy, planning,  operations, and resources through the identification of key mission  areas and the development of comprehensive strategies to satisfy  operational requirements."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This requires developing a systems approach  to these mission areas, identifying seams and gaps, and applying  appropriate resources to close these gaps and build necessary  capabilities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In such a systems approach, there must be a strong  reliance on analysis to guide key decisions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Establishing clearer links  between strategy and resources should also include the development and  submission to Congress of a Future-Year Homeland Security Plan (FYHSP),  similar to the Future-Year Defense Plan (FYDP) submitted by DoD."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The  use of a FYHSP would ensure greater stability in DHS budgets and  programs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Acquisition reform will be important as well.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Research,  development, and acquisition within the Department must be linked."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Today, research and development is the purview of the Science and  Technology Directorate, while the under secretary for management  manages the acquisition system."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This creates a natural gap between  research and development (R&D;) and acquisition, rather than having a  natural linkage between the three areas."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The result is a requirements- generation process that is largely disconnected from Departmental  acquisition programs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Another important initiative would be developing  a Department-wide approach to strategic resourcing in areas such as  screening and vetting, cybersecurity, and aviation; this shortfall has  been recognized within the Department, but additional support and  resources for this effort will be important to prospects for long-term  incorporation into DHS."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Improvements in personnel management and developing a DHS identity  and culture are essential for enhancing the effectiveness and  efficiency of the Department, as well as addressing employee morale and  satisfaction.--Central to this effort would be the development of a  Homeland Security Personnel System (HSPS) charged with the development  of leaders in the Department and within the components, as well as  assisting State, local, Tribal, and territorial (SLTT) entities with  developing their professional homeland security workforce."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Career maps  should be developed that assist in the management of personnel,  including guidance on training requirements, operational assignments,  and educational opportunities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Promotions to Senior Executive Service  (SES) and flag rank for components should be based on developing  personal and professional competence through service in a variety of  challenging and broadening assignments, including service on the DHS  staff."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For DHS staff personnel, promotion to SES and flag rank should  likewise be tied to successful service on a component staff."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Concerning management and administration, reform is necessary to  improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Department.--The roles,  missions, and functions analysis recommended earlier in my testimony  would undoubtedly identify opportunities for streamlining activities,  consolidating staffs and functions, and aligning roles and missions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Examples of several reform initiatives are provided below; however,  these should not be considered to be comprehensive, but rather  illustrative.The JRC must be formalized with appropriate legislation, as          should the Department Management Action Group (DMAG) and Senior          Leader Group (SLG), which provide senior leader direction for          the Department."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,These forums have already demonstrated utility          in taking on weighty topics such as aviation security and the          growing Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) threat.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Such          legislation would ensure that these entities survive into the          next administration.A combined staff should be developed that rotates in          talented Homeland Security professionals from across the HSE to          serve on 2-year assignments at DHS headquarters.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This would          have the benefit of infusing the DHS staff with operationally-         oriented personnel who would also grow immeasurably through the          opportunity.Organizational reform will also be required, such as          elevating the assistant secretary for policy to an under          secretary and combining the research, development, and          acquisition functions into a single organization.Finally, the Department is plagued with span of control          issues exacerbated by the distribution of headquarters          throughout the Washington, DC, area and the number of direct          reports to the Secretary and deputy secretary; a concerted          effort to consolidate several headquarters would be a useful          outcome."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Many of these management and administrative reforms will require  appropriate support and resourcing to fully implement, but they will be  essential to the achieving desired outcomes."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"During my time serving in the Department, the failure to have  stable budgets resulted in significant opportunity costs.--Uneven  spending profiles throughout a budget cycle during 1 fiscal year  resulted in 80 percent of a budget being spent in the last 3 months."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The lost momentum associated with sequestration and the Federal  workforce furlough hindered progress in the execution of key  Departmental programs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The lost man-hours associated with preparing for  and recovering from the furlough was also a significant distraction and  squandering of resources.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The effect on the workforce was palpable.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,conclusions     I have made a number of recommendations in this testimony.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However,  this is not to imply that the Department has not already been making  progress in many of these areas."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Rather, it is to highlight that these  efforts must be well-reasoned, coordinated, and comprehensive; further,  they will require both internal and external support."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"It is also useful  to remember that other DHS reform efforts have been attempted in the  past, and despite promising rhetoric, none has yet taken hold."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,A  significant cause of the failures has been not codifying these changes  through legislation.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The time for reexamining the Department and streamlining our  Nation's homeland security efforts is now.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The range of challenges  facing the Department and the HSE will continue to evolve and, in many  cases, grow."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Ensuring that preparedness and response capabilities will  keep pace necessitates a comprehensive review, followed by vigorous  implementation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In making recommendations for comprehensive reform of the  Department of Homeland Security, I remain mindful that change will be  difficult, but they are very necessary to strengthen and mature the  enterprise, and to allow the dedicated men and women who serve in the  Department and within the HSE to reach their full potential."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I appreciate the opportunity to discuss recommendations to improve  the Department, and thereby the homeland security of our Nation, and  look forward to your questions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Dr. Gerstein."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Chairman now recognizes himself for questions.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"First set of questions will go to the inspector general,  Mr. Roth."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Secure our Borders Act which was recently passed  by the committee requires CBP to fly unmanned aircraft 16 hours  each day every day of the year.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, the IG's report stated  that the Office of Air and Marine only flew them about 22  percent of the anticipated number of hours."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Now, according to CBP, this occurred because of budget  constraints and bad weather, both of which limited total flight  time."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Now, last year there were several reports of CBP loaning  out its unmanned aircraft to State and local agencies for  assistance."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"To what extent is this still occurring, if you can tell me?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Has the loaning out of these aircraft to the State and local  authorities limited CBP's ability to fly them more frequently?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Does it create additional wear and tear that leads to otherwise  unneeded maintenance?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"When we looked at the CBP's use of drones, it was basically  an audit exercise in which we took a look at how often they  were used."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We did not look at whether they were loaned out,  what purpose that they were used."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We simply used the records  that they had, which, as you indicated, showed that it was  about 20 percent of what it is that they thought they were  going to use when they started the program."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I believe other  entities--in fact, I believe the GAO may have done some work in  this area, but we have not."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Gambler, can you comment?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,GAO has not specifically looked at the use of  UAS for border security.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We did issue a report last year in  response to a mandate that asked us to review a report that the  DHS privacy office did on use of UAS along the border, but our  report and that report did not address use for border security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We do, and are happy to do some additional work in that area as  well, and do have some plans to do so."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,All right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Although the CBP had previously  reported that its unmanned aircraft operate over the entire  Southwest Border, the IG reported that CBP data showed that the  time spent flying over the border States varied significantly  by State."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In fact, the IG said unmanned aircraft appeared to  only fly over some areas of the border because they were en  route to other missions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"How does CBP explain the lack of flight hours, if you know,  over certain portions of the Southwest Border, and what, if  any, vulnerabilities might this expose according to your  research?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As you know, the Southwest Border is about 2,000  miles long."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"What our audit showed is that that vast majority of  the flights were over a 170-mile sector in Texas and Arizona,  and as a result, of course, that means that CBP is blind, does  not have the ability to have the kinds of visibility that a  drone would give in those other areas."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"What CBP tells us is that when they say they fly across the  entire Southwest Border means that they have permission from  the FAA to fly across the entire Southwest Border, but in fact  they only sort of isolate their flight times to this 170-mile  corridor."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Now, you said, I think in your testimony, that  they used 22 percent of the allocation based on the cost."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Was  that correct?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We took a look at what the cost was per flight  hour, and we looked at the total cost of the program, which is  what the guidance requires us to do, both there is OMB guidance  as well as GSA guidance as to how it is that you account for  costs of aircraft."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"What we found was that is was about $12,000  an hour to fly aircraft."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Their calculation was considerably  less than that, about $2,400 per hour."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So we disagreed with  each other by a factor of 6.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Either way, it is significantly down."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I mean,  the usage is significantly down."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I mean, we are going to hear  testimony that says that, you know, any shutdown is going to be  horrifically detrimental, and many of us agree that it will  have a significant impact, but at the same time, you can see  just by the usage of the UAS, money is being wasted where it  could be reallocated even in times where there is potential  shutdown."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In the remaining time that I have, understanding that  neither GAO or IG has delved into the possible overreach  associated with this program, I just want to bring this to  light for your further review if it appears to be in concert  with your duties."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,An incident occurred in 2012 when a North Dakota district  judge upheld the first-ever use of DHS unmanned aerial systems  to assist in the arrest of an American citizen.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"A farmer was  herding cattle, and local authorities thought he may be armed  and dangerous, and asked the DHS to fly the UAS over this  individual's home."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In the future, I would like to know if--again, if it is  within the purview of either of your jurisdictions to find out  if that, you know, results or indicates evidence of the  program's potential abuse of its power and working outside its  granted authority, and if there are in fact controls in place  to manage that authority?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"With that, I appreciate your testimony."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Now, I would like to recognize the Ranking Member, Ms.  Watson Coleman, for questioning."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"You know, from all that I have been hearing in the various  hearings about the Department of Homeland Security, it is a  relatively new Department in the history of the United States  of America."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It was formulated in response to a crisis.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"It has  done remarkable things, but it has so many more things to do in  order to be able to achieve its mission, ensure our Homeland  Security, and operate efficiently and effectively."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I also know that there are significant watchdogs, and the  two of you, Inspector General, and GAO."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In that realm, Mr.  Gerstein, you, from your experience, have observations that I  found very helpful."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I am wondering, Inspector General Roth, and, Ms."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Gambler,  in reviewing the materials today it seems that there has been  some overlapping of issues."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Do you in any way coordinate or  sort-of interact to ensure that the work that is being done by  both of you is not duplicative and that there is sort-of no  gaps in what should be identified?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We are coordinating our answer.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Yes.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We coordinate continuously.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In fact, before we ever  start an audit, one of our first things that we do is that we  call GAO to ensure, No."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"1, to ask what sort of work they have  done in the past, and, No."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"2, to make sure that we are not  stepping on something that they are already doing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So there is  a lot of coordination that takes place on the sort of  programmatic level.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Additionally, I speak with GAO all the time, my counterpart  over there who is in charge of the homeland security and  justice issues."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We have a very good sort of working  relationship, and I would note that the Inspector General Act  requires me, in fact, to coordinate with GAO, and so we take  that very seriously."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Have you all encountered any  situations where there has been conflict in--a similarity in a  finding and a conflict in a recommendation?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I am not aware of such a thing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I mean sometimes  we look at the same program.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, we have both looked  at the drone program, but we have looked at different aspects  of it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So I think it is actually highly complementary, but I  will let GAO speak for themselves."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I would just add we have the same process,  where at the start of each GAO review we contact the DHS, OIG  staff to ensure that we are not doing duplicative or  overlapping work."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We also, I think, regularly exchange lists of  on-going reviews between the two entities, and we also, as  Inspector General Roth indicated, meet periodically to talk  about the work that we are doing."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In cases where there may be  overlap or duplication of effort, we work and collaborate to  ensure that maybe we look at different aspects of the program  or something like that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Mr. Roth, your audits save money, your audits  programmatically should--probably ensure that they are  achieving the mission that we are providing the safety to the  homeland and the security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So your audit function is extremely  important.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,What happens if we fail--if Congress fails to send a  Homeland Security Funding Initiative to your auditing function  or your whole office or any part of your office?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Sure.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As you know, in a lapse of appropriation,  we can only do two things."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We can work to do things necessary  to save life and property, and we can use money that may have  been appropriated under a different source."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In other words, not  a current appropriation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Our law enforcement staff, these are  the folks who are largely on the Southwest Border, but  elsewhere, that are sort of the internal affairs component,  they are the watchers of the CBP and ICE, they will continue to  work because there has been the assessment that this is  necessary to preserve life and safety."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We have an audit staff that works on the disaster relief  fund, the FEMA work, basically, in which we have a small amount  of money left over from last year."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,That appropriation never  lapsed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So we are able to continue to have those folks work.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,But our audit staff will obviously be furloughed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We have  about 60 audits in process currently that will have to be  stopped and then obviously picked back up when we receive  funding.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Gambler, even though there has been this recognition  that under the leadership of Secretary Johnson things have  improved tremendously, is there any single most important  action that the Department's leadership should take to ensure  they remain on track to have these issues removed from the  high-risk list?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,What role do the resources play in addressing  these issues raised by the high-risk list?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,What is critical for DHS to address our high- risk designation going forward is that they continue to show  measurable and sustainable progress across their management  areas.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"What that means, to give you an example, is within  acquisition management, we have found that they have a good  knowledge-based process and policy for managing acquisitions,  and we have recognized that, and that is to the Department's  credit."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,But what we need to see now is that the Department can  consistently apply that process to its individual acquisition  programs and demonstrate that those programs are on track to  meet cost schedule and performance expectations.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In terms of resources, one of GAO's five criteria for  removal from the high-risk list is that agencies have the  capacity to resolve the risks, and when we say capacity, we  mean that they have the people and other resources."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"DHS has  identified resource needs and has identified their capacity for  a number of initiatives they have under way to address our  high-risk designation, but there are other initiatives for  which they are continuing to work to identify what resources  are needed."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I am going to yield my time back.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you very much, but I hope we have a second round of  questioning because I certainly have a lot of questions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Absolutely.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Chairman thanks the Ranking  Member.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Just remind everybody that the House bill funded OIG at  $142 million for fiscal year 2015, above the fiscal year 2014  requirement, which appears that the House did indeed do its  job."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"With that, the Chairman would now recognize the gentleman  from Florida, Mr. Clawson."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thanks for coming you all.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thanks for your service to our  country.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I am going to go back in time a little bit and ask you to  put your thinking caps on for a minute, put yourself in my  position, and help me think a little bit about how we should  view, measure the Department."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Since I have come here starting last summer, the story that  is told from other folks prior to you all coming here, and this  is good for you all to be here because you are looking at  accountability and measurables, and I want to lift that up a  little bit and so that I know a little bit more about what you  know."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We are told that things are better, that more and more  folks are being stopped on the border, and that things are  getting better throughout the Department, but that we also need  more resources."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We were asked for capital expenditure resources  as well as operational resources.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So far so good.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Right?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,But then after that most of the data that we get here is  rather anecdotal.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I can't tell you as a Member of this  committee what the goals and metrics are by function, by  region."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I hear some data, but I couldn't really roll it up."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So,  therefore, for me to get a return on investment, if you will,  for the taxpayer, I can't tell you what it is."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I haven't seen  any capex data since 2010, and yet I am asked to approve more  capex data when I haven't seen anything on a macro level about  how we are doing with our money, with the shareholder, or in  this case the taxpayer money."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So I don't know what the current goals are by area on a  macro basis, and I don't know what the current spending is for  each one of those areas, and, therefore, it is hard for me to  make any decisions without a bigger picture on how we are doing  with the resources that we currently have."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Now, you three tell me."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,You are auditors.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Your business is  to dig into the forest level, but it is also to lift above to  30,000 feet as well."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Am I missing something here?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Are there  goals on a functional level so that we can see how the  Department is doing?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"If there is goals, and if there is actual  operational data, is there a way we can get it?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I don't have a negative opinion, but neither do I have a  positive opinion."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I don't have enough data to have an informed  opinion, and you all are auditors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Am I missing something here?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We seem to wrestle around with what this thing is doing, what  that is doing, without any big picture view of what is really  going on in terms of outputs versus inputs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I don't know who to direct it to first, but I will let you  start, Honorable Mr. Roth."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I think you raise a very good and fundamental  question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I mean, certainly when we look at some of the audits  that we have done, for example, I think on the drone report,  that is one in which we really pushed them and said: What does  success look like?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,What are your metrics?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"How is it that you  can justify a $360 million expense over the course of, you  know, 5 years?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,How is it that you justify that?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Is it the  number of aliens that you caught?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Is it the number of drugs you  have seized?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,What is the metric?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,They do not have a metric.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So  it is a very frustrating aspect to me, and I can go through  audit after audit after audit."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The TSA's SPOT Program, their Behavior Analysis Program."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"It  is, like, what are your performance metrics and how do you know  whether or not you meet those performance metrics?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In other  words, for a $200 million program a year, what is it about that  that gives some comfort to us that that is money well spent?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,They couldn't answer that question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is a very frustrating  thing for us as auditors who attempt to try to get some  precision in sort-of effectiveness in Government programs when  they simply don't measure it.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So I share your frustration.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Do the other two guests share in that--it is a  rather frightening observation, and I am not partisan on this,  to spend this amount of money and not have goals and,  therefore, not knowing whether we are wasting taxpayer money or  not."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,How do the two of you feel about it?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So your question gets at a key theme of our  work as well, which is that DHS has performance measures for  some programs but not all programs, and that, you know, sort of  across the DHS spectrum that the Department and components  could strengthen their use of metrics and their use of data for  measuring progress and results."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I would also add that DHS has a Quadrennial Homeland  Security Review and a strategic plan, and we have on-going work  for the subcommittee right now looking at that higher-level  strategy that DHS has to securing the homeland and will be  reporting out to the subcommittee on that going forward."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So I would like to pick up on the theme and  take it a little bit further and talk a little bit more from an  analytical perspective.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I think it has been recognized across the Department that  there was a lack of metrics, a lack of strategy, a lack of  planning, a lack of operational ability to understand where  certain issues were with respect to solving problems."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So in the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, they did  identify--the Department identified five basic mission areas,  and for each of those there were, if you will, metrics."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"They  are high-level metrics, but they are metrics."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Can we see those metrics?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Absolutely.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Quadrennial Homeland Security  Review is a public document.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The other thing I would add is that Secretary Johnson  recognized this, and on top of the Homeland Security review has  put in place the Unity of Effort which is designed to get at  this very issue."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In fact, what the Unity of Effort is trying to  do is to pick areas so one area is cybersecurity, another is  aviation commonality, which the IG spoke about in his remarks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Another is dealing with common vetting and screening.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So  what they are trying to do in these particular areas is  identify what are the requirements in these areas, what are the  metrics that we are measuring against, where are the capability  gaps, and then satisfy them through either business process  reforms, through acquisitions, through a variety of measures."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So I think that it is certainly something that has been  thought about and understood.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Joint Requirements Council that was discussed in my  written testimony is also at the lower level, and the  adaptation of what went on with the Unity of Effort and the  Quadrennial Homeland Security Review."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I want to apologize to the----     Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Chairman thanks the gentleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson [continuing].
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Folks on the other side for  taking----     Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Chairman now recognizes the gentlelady from  California, Mrs. Torres."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I have a question for each of you, starting with Ms."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Last September the GAO issued a report on Customs and  Border Protection's covert assessments of their ability to  detect nuclear materials at their ports of entry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Given the proximity of the district I represent to the Port  of LA and Long Beach, and its impact on the labor market of my  district, this is an issue of great interest to me and my  constituents."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I noted in the report that the number of covert  tests conducted at seaports has declined from eight in 2010 to  just three in 2013.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Does CBP have the resources to conduct the number of covert  tests needed to fully assess their ability to combat nuclear  smuggling at seaports?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Congresswoman, your question gets at a key  finding that we had in that report, which is that CBP has not  conducted a risk assessment for its covert testing operations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Such a risk assessment would help CBP better allocate the  resources it has to conducting those covert operations.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"What we pointed out in our report was that such a risk  assessment could include looking at the locations for testing,  the types of material to be tested, and the types of technology  to be tested."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So we have recommended that CPB conduct that risk  assessment to prioritize and make best use of the resources it  has.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would encourage you to continue that work.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,This is a critical issue for us.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We are not talking about human  beings crossing, but, you know, these are weapons that could be  utilized and create mass chaos in our communities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Inspector General Roth, in a recent report your office  estimated that it costs approximately $12,255 per hour to  operate CBP Air and Marine's unmanned aircraft system, UAS,  program."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However, the office of Air and Marine calculated a  cost of $2,468 per flight hour because they did not include  operating costs such as the cost of pilots, equipment, and  overhead."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The OIG made a recommendation which CPB concurred  with, but only in principle."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Can you explain to us all of the factors that should be  taken into account when determining the cost per hour for  operating UAS, and are you confident that CBP will implement  your recommendations at this point?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As you note, they did not include many  of the costs that we believe ought to be included, including  the cost of the pilots, the cost of the sort of satellite  uplink, for example, the cost to--the overhead on the runways,  the cost of the pilots, those kinds of things, the cost of  depreciation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In other words, the wear and tear on the  aircraft."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Those are the kinds of things that the Office of  Management and Budget and GSA require that a program count so  we understand what the full cost of the operation are.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I always  like to use the analogy of my teenage son who wants to buy a  car, and, you know, it is not just the cost of the car."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"You  have to have your insurance, you have to have your gas, you  have to figure out where you are going to park it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,You have to  put some money away for maintenance when you need that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"That is  what CBP has not done here, and that was the basis of one of  our more significant objections."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We are in a 90-day period in which they are assessing our  recommendations, and they are going to come back to us with  what it is that they say that they are going to do."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I can't  predict what they are ultimately going to say about our fairly  strong recommendation that all of the costs be accounted for,  but we will certainly keep this committee apprised as we go."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Mr. Gerstein, in your prepared testimony you cite to some  of the problems that arise from the distribution of the  Department of Homeland Security's headquarter staff throughout  the Washington, DC area."

"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Having served in leadership positions  with the Department of Homeland Security, what is your opinion  of the benefits that would be derived from completing the  consolidated headquarters project, and will doing so have  benefits for both operations, and most importantly to me,  workforce morale?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thanks.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Well, I am not going to take an exact  position on St. Elizabeths, if you don't mind, but I would like  to talk about building a culture and an identity within the  Department of Homeland Security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"What it feels like having  worked there for a number of years, and served in leadership  positions, building this identity, a common way of moving  forward is really important."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is based on personal  relationships.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is based on having this common identity.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Right now the Department is spread out over 20 different  sites within--20 large sites within the Washington area alone,  and that makes it very difficult to bring people together."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"While modern technology helps, there still needs to be more in  terms of bringing people into a common area."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"On the St. Elizabeths, I know that, you know, it is a great  facility."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Coast Guard is there now, but it is my  understanding that it would not be large enough to house the  entire Department staff in that single facility."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would yield back my time to Mrs. Watson Coleman if she  needs extra time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Chairman thanks the gentlewoman, and now  recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Loudermilk."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Loudermilk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would like to go back to the cost of flying the unmanned  aircraft.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I believe the IG reported the cost of $12,255 per  hour to operate the aircraft."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As an aviator, I find that  astounding that--especially an unmanned aircraft, you know,  where the CBP estimated, you know, I think $2,468 per flight  hour."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Why is there such a differential and why is the cost per  man hour so high, especially for an unmanned aerial vehicle?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,There is a couple things.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The differential is  that we simply are bound by our auditing standards.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We are  outside auditors.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We go in.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We don't have a dog in the fight,  as it were."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is not our program.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We simply look at the  program in an objective way.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We use the standards that are  already out there that are set by OMB and GSA, and this is the  number we came up with, and we are fairly transparent as to how  we got that number."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"It is on page 8 of our report, if you would  like to see it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Now, because they fly the aircraft so few hours, that means  the cost per hour is high."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Of course, if they fly it more, then  the cost per hour will decrease."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So that is one of our  recommendations, of course, just like because if Southwest  Airlines, you can guarantee when they buy an aircraft, they use  it, and they use it to its full potential, and that is  certainly one of our recommendations."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"If you use these to the  full potential like you said you were going to do in your  concept of operations when you purchased it, then the cost per  hour is going to go down."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Loudermilk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So to follow up, you are basically--you are  taking the full cost, including the salary, benefits of the  pilot, the camera operator, or that is included in the cost per  hour of operation?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Correct.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"You know, there is a loaded cost for  each personnel."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So, for example, CBP did not have the cost of  the pilots because in their sort of thinking, well, that is  being paid for out of a separate pot."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"They didn't include, for  example, what it costs the Coast Guard to, you know, assist in  these missions, particularly the over water missions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"They didn't talk about their office of intelligence and law  enforcement liaison because that is in a different budget sort- of line, which is all sort-of valid except it all comes out of  the taxpayer's pocket anyway."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So we need to count everything so  when the Secretary looks at the program he can understand  what--or Congress looks at the program, you can understand  truly what it costs and is this the right investment of money."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Loudermilk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,How many flight hours does an average pilot  have?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I mean, are you talking about increasing the number of  hours that we fly, which from my trip to the border we see the  effectiveness of the UAVs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Are our pilots--do they have subsequent down time that they  are not flying that they could fly more hours without us hiring  more unmanned pilots?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I don't know the answer to that question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is  not reflected in our report.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I can certainly get back to you  and see if that is something that we looked at as far as  whether or not it is scalable.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In other words, to be able to  fly five times as many hours, do we need X number more pilots?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I will say that according to our analysis, they spend about  $11 million a year on pilot salaries for the UAV program."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Loudermilk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So with that--if we had to hire more  pilots, then we wouldn't necessarily see a decline in the cost  per hour because we are going to be incurring the cost of more  pilots."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,That is what I am getting at.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Somewhere there is a  differential, I think, beyond just the cost of the pilots in  there, and that is what I was trying to get to because if--it  makes sense if we have the pilots are not flying their full  allotted hours or their capability, whatever the regulation  says you can fly this many hours in a week or time frame."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So that is kind-of where I was getting at.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Is it an  accounting difference, or are we spending a lot more on these  unmanned vehicles?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Is there some areas that we can save money  without affecting the operation and our capabilities?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I understand your question now.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Is it linear, in  other words----     Mr. Loudermilk."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Exactly.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth [continuing].
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Or not and certainly some of the  issues--certainly fuel would be linear, cost of pilots would be  linear."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Some of the other would not be linear.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The  depreciation, for example."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The overhead of the program  management, which is about $5 million a year, that is going to  be the case whether you are flying or not flying."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The overhead  on the facilities itself, the runways and the--that kind of  facility would not be linear."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So there are no--I know there are fixed costs that could be  distributed over greater flight hours, but I don't have the  specific data."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Loudermilk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I appreciate that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I yield back.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Chairman thanks the gentleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Now Chairman recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr.  Richmond."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Richmond.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"My first question would be directed to Mr. Roth, and our  committee, and especially through our Ranking Member, we have  been trying to get the Department of Homeland Security to give  us information regarding its suspension and disbarment program  in terms of contractors."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We have asked them for a number of  things, especially when one of their components recommends a  disbarment or suspension and they don't do it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So in that sense, has the Office of Inspector General  recently conducted a review of the suspension and disbarment  process at DHS?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We have not published any audit reports on that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I think we are doing some preliminary work on that issue.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I  share with you the concern.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"My prior background is as a  criminal prosecutor and we have done a number of cases on sort  of acquisition fraud kinds of work, and I understand the  strength that can occur as a result of a very vigorous  suspension and debarment program."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Sometimes you can't make a criminal case or you can't even  make a false claims case, and yet you could do something to  ensure that those folks aren't in fact selling to the  Government anymore."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I think it has an enormous deterrent effect  when used properly.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So I share your concerns with regard to our program, but we  haven't any published reports on that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Richmond.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Off-hand would you know any rules,  regulations, or statutes that would give them the ability to  deny us access to the recommendations from their components or  the list of people who were recommended for debarment or  suspension and then their ultimate action?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Would you know of anything that would give them privilege  or keep them from giving us that information in writing?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"You know, off the top of my head, I am not aware  of it, but, candidly, I haven't done any analysis of that  issue."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Richmond.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Well, good that is my last question."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Okay.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Richmond.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Which is, would you be open to conducting  such a review to ensure decisions are being arrived at upon--in  a consistent and equitable manner?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would like to take that back to my auditors and  see what it is that we could in that area.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,What I would like to  do is perhaps have our staffs meet to get a better sense of  what it is that you are looking at and see whether or not there  can be work that could be done.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Richmond.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The next question would be for Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I know that  last December you all issued a report on Federal facilities  cybersecurity that stated that DHS and GSA should address cyber  risks to building and access control systems.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In the course of  its audit, GAO found that DHS lacks a comprehensive strategy  for addressing the issue."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So given GAO's recent work in this  area, could you please elaborate for the subcommittee on the  actions DHS and GSA need to take to ensure that our Federal  facilities are hardened against a cyber attack?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Sure.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you for the question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As you  noted, we recommended in that report that DHS work with GSA to  come up with a strategy for assessing cyber risks to building  and access control systems in Federal facilities."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We  specifically recommended that that strategy include a  definition of what the problem is, assigns roles and  responsibilities, identifies a methodology for assessing that  risk, and some other things as well."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We also recommended through our report that the Interagency  Security Committee, which is housed within DHS and among other  things, provide some guidelines and guidance for Federal  facility security standards, that they should include some  information in their documents and their guidance about what  the threat is from cyber risk and that that information would  help Federal agencies better assess what their risks are."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Richmond.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I will try to squeeze in one last question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Back to Mr.  Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Last Congress, as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on  Transportation Security, we worked on addressing TSA's  acquisition policies."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I noted in your testimony that your  office will be working with DHS acquisitions in the near term.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So is the problem with DHS's acquisition management derived  from the Department not having clear policies and procedures in  place for the components?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Or is that the components all too  often disregard the policies that are in place?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Congressman, it is a little bit of both."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Certainly for a long time there had not been the right kinds of  procedures and policies in place.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I think that Secretary  Johnson has made a very strong effort in the time that he has  been Secretary to put some rationality and some function behind  sort-of a unified effort to do acquisition management.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,But we  have also seen instances in which the components simply  disregard what the Department has asked to do.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,There really  hasn't been any consequences for that disobedience.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"One of the things that I worry about is that  notwithstanding Mr. Johnson's efforts, he will be at some point  gone, and whether or not I will be here in 2 years asking  whether or not the same kinds of issues are taking place."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In  other words, are there the right kinds of policies and  procedures in place and is there someone there who is actually  enforcing them?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Certainly the kinds of legislation that we have  seen come out of the House I think has been a very welcome  development.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Last term I know that the House passed the Acquisition  Accountability and Efficiency Act, which I thought was a good  development."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I look forward to those kinds of pieces of  legislation in ensuring that the acquisition management  function at DHS continues beyond this administration.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Richmond.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Chairmman thanks the gentleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Chairman now recognizes himself for the beginning of  the second round, or the beginning of the second round."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The first question will go to Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The GAO recently  reported that DHS had such a large backlog of Freedom of  Information Act, or FOIA, requests that it set a goal of  reducing them by 15 percent each year since 2011."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"However,  although there was initial progress in fiscal year 2012, the  number of backlog requests nearly doubled in fiscal year 2013  with over 23,000, 23,000 more unfulfilled FOIA requests in  fiscal year 2013 than in the prior year."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I mean, that is  astounding this agency is that far behind in answering the  hard-working taxpayers that are paying for it and their  legitimate requests."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The question to you is: Has the DHS done enough to  realistically believe that they would be able to tackle the  backlog of requests from the taxpayers?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"There were a few key recommendations that we  made in our report, Chairman, which we believe would help DHS  improve its processing and handling of FOIA requests."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"One is for them to update their Department-wide FOIA  regulation, it hasn't been updated since 2003, to make sure  that regulation takes account of everything that has changed in  the FOIA environment since that time."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We have also recommended  that DHS and the components do a better of job of taking  account of and tracking and fully tracking the costs that they  spend responding to FOIA requests.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Finally, in doing our work, we found that there was the  potential for some overlap in the processing of immigration- related FOIA requests, which is a large number of the requests  that DHS gets."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So we recommended, to help reduce that  duplication and overlap and help to insert some efficiency,  that DHS and the two components involved, ICE and USCIS, should  look at coming to an agreement about how to process those more  efficiently."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I think you said that DHS's Privacy Office has  not updated its FOIA regulations in more than 10 years despite  updates to the policy.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Do I have that correct?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,That is right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Their FOIA regulation has not  been updated since 2003.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,There has been some changes  Government-wide to FOIA requirements and policies since that  time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Do you think that a lack of transparency in the  Privacy Office has exacerbated that backlog?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Chairman, that wasn't something that we  specifically looked at in the report."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"But we did find and  describe in the report that the FOIA processing is, you know,  sort-of specific to the components."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is the components'  responsibility to respond to FOIA requests.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So our  recommendations were geared to helping the Department provide  some oversight for how FOIA requests are handled and processed.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So each department would have its own separate  staff to deal with the FOIA requests for that department, is  that essentially correct?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Each component, yes, sir."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Each component.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I imagine the size of that  varies per component, the administrative size I mean, is that  your understanding?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I believe so, yes."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The components I think get  different numbers of FOIA requests.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Dr. Gerstein, maybe you can shed--as you have  looked at the organizational structure, do you have anything to  add regarding the efficiency or trying to clear up this  backlog, that what you studied might be germane?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I just know from the S&T; perspective, Science  and Technology Directorate, that we were working very hard to  get at the backlogs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I will say there were a couple of FOIA  requests that were very, very complex and required a great deal  of work to be able to dig out literally thousands of emails to  be able to provide on a particular request."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So it is not a  trivial process to provide this information.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Okay, thank you."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Then moving on to my final questioning for the round is to  find out if there is anybody on the panel that is familiar with  what is known as the single point of failure in the Amtrak  corridor?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"This relates to cybersecurity and the construction of  an alternate petabyte pathway, where Homeland Security was the  initial impetus for demand of a diverse broadband pathway from  the blast zones associated with the major thoroughfares of  Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore, and the District of Columbia  and where we stand on that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Can anybody speak to that?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Or is  that something that you are unfamiliar with?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For GAO, I am not sure, but we would be  happy--I would be happy to check and get back with you and your  staff."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,All right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would appreciate it if you would.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"At this time, I yield time for the second round to the  Ranking Member, Ms. Watson Coleman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Mr. Gerstein, I keep reading that morale is the big issue  in this Department."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I guess to some extent it does impact the  Department's ability to accomplish its mission and do the  things that GAO and the inspector general is concerned about.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I  also understand that there have been a number of contracts let  to study, to survey the issues of morale."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So I am wondering with your experience and your knowledge,  whatever happened to the recommendations, the findings and the  recommendations and why are they still doing them?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Have they  ever implemented any of them?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So the impetus for a lot of the employee  viewpoint studies is really the OPM, the Office of Personnel  Management, study that comes out on an annual basis."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is  administered in April to June.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It comes out in November.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Then,  of course, you know, there is efforts by leadership to respond  and be able to think through the issues."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So the question really before us is why then, if you are  doing an annual survey, do you need other surveys to augment  those?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The answer is actually fairly straightforward.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"You know,  when we got our results to the Science and Technology  Directorate, the annual survey, it lacked the granularity to be  able to understand at what level of leadership, for example,  there were criticisms."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So we asked for an internal study to be  done, an internal survey that looked specifically and tried to  identify specifically at what levels we might have shortfalls  in the leadership."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,There were some things that came out of the survey that  made a great deal of sense.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For example, one of the great  criticisms within the piece that directly was related to the  Science and Technology Directorate had to do with shortfalls in  funding."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So many people answered very negatively about science  and technology resourcing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Of course, that is the year, in 2011  and 2012, in which the Department and Science and Technology  Directorate in particular saw a 56 percent reduction in  research and development."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So no surprise that the workforce  would be signaling in that way.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Now, on the other question of what are done with all the  surveys, I guess I would say that I think there are a number of  subordinate organizations, components, who do their own  internal surveys much like the Science and Technology  Directorate did."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Then at the Department level, there is a lot  of effort to try to understand what the survey results are  actually yielding."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So that is the impetus for doing these surveys.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Is anyone contacting these external  organizations who do these surveys to make the final  recommendations?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Then does the Department implement any of  them?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Well, for example, in Science and Technology,  we used an outside organization to help us."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"You know, we looked  at the results and we are working to implement change."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So, yes, I do think that they are helpful in trying to  identify areas and provide more granularity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,This is actually for both Mr. Roth and Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Gambler, because  it has to do with the TSA."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"To the extent you can discuss  findings which you have with regard to the management  conclusion, findings which rely heavily on the behavior  detection policies has fundamental flaws to introduce  unnecessary security risks into the aviation environment."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"If, in fact, we are talking about the sort of profiling  that has no scientific basis, Ms."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Gambler, has the Department  implemented any of your recommendations with regard to having  less reliance on that, as opposed to expanding its inclusion?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As you know, the report that we issued with regard to the  PreCheck program is classified both at the SSI and Secret  level."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So it is very difficult in this environment to give you  an answer to that question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would say that we have some very  deep concerns as to some of the decisions that TSA has made  with regard to the Managed Inclusion and PreCheck program.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So we can have a, then sort-of closed- door discussion on this at some point in the very near future?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We welcome a briefing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We can describe exactly  what our concerns are in a closed briefing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Mr. Roth."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,GAO has also acknowledged that this is not a scientific- based approach.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Has the Department implemented any of your--or  TSA implemented any of your recommendations?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So with regard to the most recent  recommendation we made about the behavioral detection program,  we had recommended that TSA should limit funding for the  program until they were able to show scientifically-validated  evidence that behaviors can be used to detect--or behavioral  indicators can be used to detect threats."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,TSA disagreed with our recommendation on that report.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In  doing our follow-up on our recommendations, we understand that  TSA is reviewing the program."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,That is under way right now.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So  at this point, it is unclear the extent to which that will meet  the intent of our recommendation."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Watson Coleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Chairman thanks the gentlewoman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Chairman recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr.  Clawson."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Okay.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So let's go back to what we were  speaking about earlier and maybe you all can help me a little  bit.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,A strategy always flows from current situation and tactics  flow from strategy.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I personally don't have enough data yet to  have an overall view of what the current situation is.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So if  you all could do me a favor, maybe get together with my team  and I, somebody, who would it be that I could get the very  basic, top-level data about what is going on in the Department  and so that I can see the top-data, operational metrics, let's  say, border, cybersecurity, whatever the area it is, and so how  we are doing, how that data relates to the goals."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Then, second, the capex, capital expenditures, my area, so  that I can build just a cursory knowledge of taxpayer value  here and how we are doing for the money that we are spending."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"You know, I don't know on the border if that means per dollar  spent how many people we are stopping or not."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I don't know what  your metric is.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I don't know how we ever stand up here and give  opinions without metrics.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It feels a little weird to me.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So we don't even have to do it publicly.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"But if I could get  some metrics, after being up here 6 or 8 months, at a top level  by area of the Department, that would be great."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,You all can  come.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Inspector, you probably know where, if it is not you, you  probably know where we can get that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So that is my request  first of all.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Would you like to respond to that or--because we looked at  the Quadrennial Homeland Review.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,That is just more strategy to  me.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is very few metrics by area of the Department.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I want to  know who is making their goals and who is not and why.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Yes,  sir."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I think that is a fair request.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We would welcome  to work with you----     Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Yeah, if you all would come and be one of  those groups that when we ask something, you actually come back  to us."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We will be responsive.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I am not partisan about this.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I am not trying to make the  administration look bad or anybody else.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would just like to  have an opinion on how the Department is doing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"With no data, I  just don't know how anybody ever has opinions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It is just  rumors to me.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We make mistakes when we make decisions based on  assumptions, as opposed to separating what we assume from what  we know."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Before I accuse anybody of anything, I would like to have  more than just an assumption."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Does it seem reasonable you all  what I am asking?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Yes----     Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Then from there, hopefully I can be helpful  and my team can be helpful even in a small way."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Second thing, if we have just another moment, it always  felt to me in my career that morale was driven more by  management's ability to manage up, as opposed to senior  management's ability to manage down."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Things always come from  Washington or whatever and they don't understand the situation  on the ground, right?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So we make rules and edicts based on what  we think is going on.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We never really know.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,That sends  confusing messages to the folks that actually are trying to get  the work done on the front lines.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Sounds reasonable.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Clearly we have a confused situation in terms of the goals  of this Department, in Washington, with the potential shutdown  and everything that is going on."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So in my mind, I wonder to  myself, I say if I was in senior management in this Department,  on the one hand, what I am hearing is the confused signal from  Washington clearly would have an impact--negative impact on  morale, right?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"On the other hand, you tell me that the  Department is getting better and better, that things are  getting clearer because of new management."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"To me, that would override some of the concerns about  morale."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Because morale is usually more local than it is global.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Tell me how you feel about the morale question then.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Do you  have an opinion?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,You are out there all the time.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Any of the  three.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,GAO issued a report on employee morale at DHS  a couple of years ago.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I think a key take-away from that report  is getting at your question and your thoughts, sir, which is,  you know, that looking at sort-of what is happening within the  individual components is, you know, an important piece of this,  and the extent to which the components are implementing, you  know, actions to address some of the root causes that are  contributing to employee morale."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So that was a key finding and  recommendation from the report that GAO did several years ago  on morale at DHS.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So that would say that the hiring process is  the most important input on morale at a local basis?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"We didn't get into sort-of specifically tying,  you know, morale problems to sort-of different functions or  things like that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,But we did look at the sort-of differences in  morale at the individual components.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,That was a key part of the  work that we did.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Anybody else on the morale question?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We haven't done any work on that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I mean, I will  have to say I was in the Department of Justice for 25 years."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Nineteen of those years were in the field and we didn't really  care what was going on in Washington.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"What we cared about was  did we have the tools to do our job, and did your immediate  boss appreciate what it is that you are doing?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I don't actually  think it is very complicated.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,But that is just my personal  opinion based on my experience.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It feels to me that we overestimate our own  importance in Washington in this decision.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,That it is exactly  what you say.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Any input, Doctor?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Well, the one thing that I would like to just  add and it has to do with the shutdown on the impact of morale."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I was acting under secretary the last time we had a major  furlough.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It was about 3 weeks long.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I can say that this  affected the workforce in some fairly dramatic ways.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I agree with that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We spent a lot of time after that talking to  the workforce and trying to reinforce the importance of the  jobs they are doing and that people do care about them.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"You  know, as you say, a lot of what goes on in Washington just goes  on in Washington."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"But, you know, you sort-of have--at the end  of that rope are people who are depending on their paychecks."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Some of them were working at-risk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Peace on that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I mean, you take people's  paycheck and job away, even temporarily, then the local manager  can't do much about that."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The other thing that is very interesting is  that recovering from a furlough is a lot more time-intensive  than just the amount of time of the furlough.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Clawson.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Right.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Chairman thanks the gentleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Chairman  now recognizes the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Torres."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Mr. Gerstein, in your written testimony, you  state that the lost momentum associated with sequestration and  our Federal workforce furlough in 2013 hindered programs in the  execution of key Departmental programs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,You also stated that  the lost man-hours associated with preparing for and recovering  from the furloughs were also a significant distraction and  squandering of resources.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Now, let's go back to that statement, confused signals from  the District of Columbia."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Today, with one day left to fund the  Department of Homeland Security, can you explain for the  subcommittee what is going on behind the scenes at the  Department of Homeland Security and the impact appropriations  uncertainty is having on the workforce?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Yeah.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So that is a great question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We started  planning for and thinking about the impact of a potential  furlough back when the original discussion occurred about the  potential for DHS not getting funded.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So for a number of months  we have been talking about that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The planning will be more  intensive as we get closer to the furlough.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I will use the last time as a template.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"But, you know,  several weeks before, we were putting out email messages, we  were notifying employees, we were trying to explain the impact  to the employees."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So as we lead up into it, there is a lot of  activity."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Obviously, when the furlough occurs, no work is  supposed to occur."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"For the Department, that has a lot of the  management functions, the under secretary for management,  science, and technology, the policy office, intelligence and  analysis, would be predominately, about 15 percent of the  Department would be those that are most affected."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Then, of course, when the furlough is lifted and people  come back to work, there is, if you will, a stutter-step in  getting back into the business of running the Department."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,One interesting area that I think is really important to  consider as a microcosm of what actually happens is in the  programs.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So the impact on these programs is very significant.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We don't know what the money is going to be.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We don't know what  the top line is going to be.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So instead of planning your  procurements, in our case it was the research and development,  over the course of a year and try to front-load that in the  early part of the year, we don't have the money, we don't know  what our top line is going to be."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So you don't actually spend  that money.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,What that creates is a bow wave.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"That means in the last, if you will, 3, 4 months of a  fiscal year, you are spending 80 percent of your resources."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Obviously, when you are trying to put that much through the  system at all one time, it becomes very difficult."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Imagine the  impact, for example, on contracting."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Imagine how it is on  procurement as you are trying to move vast numbers of contracts  through the system.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So there is a huge opportunity cost in waiting until the  last half of the fiscal year to be able to do that.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We are  actually very quickly approaching the second part of the fiscal  year for fiscal year 2015.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I want to get one more question for the record.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In your  recent op-ed, you say that the Department of Homeland Security  is in a similar position that the Department of Defense was 30  years ago, when the Department underwent a major organizational  restructuring."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,How would you compare the Department of Homeland  Security's process to that of the Department of Defense?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Is DHS  far behind where DOD was?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Or is DHS experiencing the normal  growing pains in a relatively new, very massive organization?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So I do think there are a lot of normal  growing pains associated with bringing together so many people,  the third largest Cabinet-level department, so rapidly."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"On the other hand, and I used the Goldwater-Nichols analogy  not because I am trying to make the point of recreating a  Department of Defense within the Department of Homeland  Security, but rather the need for a very significant,  comprehensive reform initiative."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So there are a lot of  differences between the Department of Defense and Department of  Homeland Security, not the least of which are military missions  versus law enforcement within the Department of Homeland  Security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"When you think about just the resources, it is almost an  order of magnitude difference between the Department of Defense  and Department of Homeland Security, something like $550  billion versus about $60 billion for the Department of Homeland  Security."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"When you look at the training time available for law  enforcement versus people in military uniforms, that is also  different."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So there are some differences.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"But on the other hand, we really saw a vast improvement in  the Department of Defense when they came together and worked as  a single entity and were able to pool the resources and think  more corporately."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mrs. Torres.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Chairman thanks the gentlewoman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The Chairman now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr.  Loudermilk."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Loudermilk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Gambler, unfortunately DHS does have a history of  acquisitions of technologies and programs that either turn out  they don't meet the mission needs or they are inadequate and,  in the case of SBInet, were inevitably pulled--which I believe  was a Boeing contract and we spent about $1 billion for 53  miles of surveillance."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"The other would be BioWatch, that working with the EPA to  detect pathogens in the air and such things."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,What are some  things that you recommend that we can do to better vet or run  through a process technologies or programs before we go into an  acquisition?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"It almost seems like sometimes we are actually  going into the acquisition process to do the testing to see if  it works, instead of putting the onus on the vendor to prove  the viability of their program."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Do you have some recommendations of where we could do to  save taxpayer moneys before we waste it on programs that  inevitably we end up pulling just like SBInet?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Ms.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Gambler.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"That question gets at a key point from our  work on acquisition management at DHS, which is that many DHS  acquisition programs don't have the basic fundamental documents  and information in place to be able to, you know, successfully  procure and manage those programs."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Those things include having  reliable schedules, having reliable life-cycle cost estimates,  and having in place what are called program baselines that  basically lay out what is the acquisition program going to do,  at what cost is it going to be delivered, and when."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So what we have recommended and what we need to see as part  of the high-risk update and our monitoring of DHS's designation  of high-risk in the acquisition management area, is that the  Department can better ensure that its individual programs are  adhering to acquisition management practices and have those key  documents in place so that they can be, you know, better  managed and monitored to be on track for schedule, cost, and  performance."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Loudermilk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Okay.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Would any of the others like to  comment?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would say that I am very familiar with all  the programs that you named.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"When you peel back the onion on  those, there is a, if you will, a single point of failure."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,It  has to do with insufficiency in the requirements-generation  process.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"In other words, you don't necessarily know what you  are trying to achieve or you change your requirement part-way  through the acquisition without changing the metrics, the key  performance parameters."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So requirements, requirements,  requirements are absolutely essential to be able to have good  procurements and good acquisition."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Loudermilk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Roth.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I would simply concur.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I mean, certainly in  audits that we have looked at, at this, it is--the technology  is chasing the problem, as opposed to defining the problem and  figuring out the solution for it."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Loudermilk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"So in the case of, let's say, SBInet, we  were throwing a potential solution at a problem that we haven't  really defined how we want to resolve it, is that what you are  getting at?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"As we get into it, we find out that it is not  meeting the criteria, so we change the requirements?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I guess  what I am getting at is that result in the cost overruns  because we are chasing something without fully defining what  the mission is or what the accomplishment is?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I mean is that  pretty much what you are stating?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,That we have to do a better  job at defining what it is we want?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I mean, what is the  solution?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Gerstein.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"I think when you do a requirements  generation, you have to link your research, your development,  and your acquisition so that they actually flow."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,They don't  necessarily have to be completely linear.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,But you do have to do  a certain amount of research to understand the problem and to  help identify what potential solutions are.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So not everything is an acquisition.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,You may have solutions  that are doctrine solutions or organizational adaptations or  training differences or acquisition.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,So all of that has to be  factored in.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,How can I solve the operational problem that I am  encountering?
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,That is really the fundamental question.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Then  that would suggest then being able to lay out acquisition  programs in a holistic manner so that you are not just  identifying a technology, as the IG says, Mr. Roth said, you  know, you are not just identifying a technology and saying this  will work for our problem, but rather thinking, how it is going  to fit into a comprehensive system?"
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Loudermilk.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Okay.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Thank you.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,I yield back.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,Mr. Perry.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The Chairman thanks the gentleman.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"At this time, the Chairman thanks the witnesses for their  valuable testimony and the Members for their questions."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,The  Members of the subcommittee may have some additional questions  for the witnesses.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,We will ask you to respond to these  questions in writing.
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Pursuant to committee rule 7E, the  hearing record will be open for 10 days."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"Without objection, the subcommittee stands adjourned."
"
"
CHRG-114hhrg94109,"[Whereupon, at 11:34 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]"
